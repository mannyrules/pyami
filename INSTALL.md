# preamble
Since there are other packages called `pyami` (nothing to do with us) the formal name in `PyPI` will be `py4ami`. Informally we may use `pyami`. There are two sections here, for those who want to download and use `py4ami` and those who are developing and uploading.


# Installation for users (download)
`py4ami` is now a `PyPI` project and by default will be installed from there. `py4ami` is now versioned as `d.d.d` Generally you should install the latest version unless indicated.
