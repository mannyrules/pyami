  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id731">Limiting warming to well below 2&#176;C will require substantial energy system changes over the next 
30 years. This includes reduced fossil fuel consumption, increased production from low- and zero-
carbon  energy  sources,  and  increased  use  of  electricity  and  alternative  energy  carriers.</span>
  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id734">  Coal 
consumption  without  CCS  falls  by  67%  to  82%  (interquartile  range)  in  2030  in  scenarios  limiting 
warming to 1.5&#176;C with no or limited overshoot. Oil and gas consumption fall more slowly. Low-carbon 
sources produce 93% to 97% of global electricity by 2050 in scenarios that limit likely warming to 2&#176;C 
or  below.  In  scenarios  limiting  warming  to  1.5&#176;C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot  (likely  below  2&#176;C), 
electricity supplies 48% to 58% (36% to 47%) of final energy in 2050, up from 20% in 2019. </span>
