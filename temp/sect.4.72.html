  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id999">Nuclear 
power and hydropower are already established technologies. Solar PV and wind are now cheaper than 
fossil-generated electricity in many locations. Bioenergy accounts for about a tenth of global primary 
energy. Carbon capture is widely used in the oil and gas industry, with early applications in electricity 
production and biofuels. It will not be possible to widely deploy all of these and other options without 
efforts to address the geophysical, environmental-ecological, economic, technological, socio-cultural, 
and institutional factors that can facilitate or hinder their implementation. (</span>
