  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1343">: The literature points to well-understood policy measures and technologies 
for  accelerating  mitigation,  though  the  balance  depends  on  country  specificities:  1)  decarbonising

of energy than today; 3) electrification of end-uses including transport; 4) dramatically lower use of 
fossil fuels than today; 5) converting other uses to low- or zero-carbon fuels (e.g., hydrogen, bioenergy, 
ammonia) in hard-to-decarbonise sectors; 6) promote bioenergy, demand reduction, dietary changes, 
and policies, incentives, and rules for mitigation in the land sector; 7) setting and meeting ambitious 
targets to reduce methane and other short-lived climate forcers. Charting just transitions to net zero may 
provide a vision, which policy measures can help achieve. Though there is increasing experience with 
pricing carbon directly or indirectly, decision-makers might consider a broader toolbox of enablers and 
levers that is available in domains that have not traditionally been climate policy. {4.5, Annex II Part
