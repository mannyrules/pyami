</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19486">What  have  we  learned  so  far?  As  highlighted  above,  despite  30  years  of  UNFCCC  and  growing 
contributions  by  non-state  actors,  the  emissions  gap  keeps  growing  (4.2.2  and  4.2.3).  Mitigation 
conceived as incremental change is not enough. Meeting ambitious mitigation goals entails rapid, non-
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19490">marginal changes in production and consumption patterns (4.2.4 and 4.2.5). Taking another approach, 
we have seen in section 4.3 that shifting development pathways broadens the scope for mitigation (4.3.1, 
4.3.2) and offers more opportunities than mitigation alone to combine mitigation with the realisation of 
other SDGs (4.3.1, Cross-Chapter Box 5).  
</span></div><div style="" id="id19495"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19496">A  practical  way  forward  is  to  combine  shifting  development  pathways  and  accelerating  mitigation

policy,  governance  and  institutional  capacity,  finance,  behaviour  and  lifestyles  and  innovation  and 
technology (de Coninck et al. 2018). As Figure 4.8 illustrates, </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19594">public policies</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19595"> are required to foster both 
accelerating mitigation and shifting development pathways. They are also vital to guide and provide the 
other enabling conditions (cf. Table 4.12). Improved governance and enhanced institutional capacity 
facilitate the adoption of policies that accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways, with the 
potential  to  achieve  multiple  mitigation  and  development  objectives.  Finance  is  required  both  to 
accelerate mitigation and to shift development pathways. Chapter 15 argues that near-term actions to 
shift the financial system over the next decade (2021-2030) are critically important and feasible, and 
that the immediate post-COVID recovery opens up opportunities to scale up financing from billions to 
trillions  (15.6.7)  (Mawdsley  2018).  As  discussed  in  section  4.2.5,  accelerated  mitigation  pathways 
encompass both rapid deployment of new technologies such as CCS or electric vehicles, as well as 
changes in consumption patterns: rapid deployment of mitigation </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19606">technology</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19607"> and </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19608">behaviour change</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19609"> are 
thus two enabling conditions to accelerated mitigation. Dynamics of deployment of technologies are 
relatively well known, pointing to specific, short-term action to accelerate innovation and deployment 
(Cross-Chapter  Box  12),  whereas  dynamics  of  collective  behaviour  change  is  less  well  understood. 
Arguably, the latter also facilitates shifting development pathways.

innovative technology, policy intervention was frequent, especially in the more rapid ones (Grubb et al. 
2021;  Michaelowa  et  al.  2018).  Likewise,  it  is  not  expected  that  spontaneous  behaviour  change  or 
market evolution alone yield the type of transformations outlined in the accelerated mitigation pathways 
described in 4.2.5, or in the shifts in development pathways described in 4.3.3. On the contrary, stringent 
temperature targets imply bold policies in the short term (Rockstr&#246;m et al. 2017; Kriegler et al. 2018) 
to enforce effective existing policy instruments and regulations, as well as to reform or remove harmful 
existing policies and subsidies (D&#237;az et al. 2019).

pathways  that  fosters  accelerated  mitigation  may  best  be  achieved  through  integrated  actions  that 
comprise policies in support of the broader SDG agenda, based on country-specific priorities (4.3.2, 
13.8, 13.9). These may include for example, fiscal policies, or integrating industrial (Nilsson et al. 2021) 
and energy policies (Fragkos et al. 2021) with climate policies. Similarly, sectoral transitions that aspire 
to shifting development pathways towards sustainability often have multiple objectives, and deploy a 
diverse mix or package of policies and institutional measures (Cross-Chapter Box 5).

and requires sufficiently strong and competent institutions  (Stiglitz 1998). For example,  shift away

of financial and capital assets and shifting of political-economic power. Ensuring the decision-making 
process  is  not  unduly  influenced  by  actors  with  much  to  lose  is  key  to  managing  a  transformation. 
Effective governance, as noted in Chapter 13, requires establishing strategic direction, coordination of 
policy responses, and mediation among divergent interests.  Among varieties of climate governance, 
which institutions emerge is path-dependent, based on the interplay of national political institutions, 
international drivers, and bureaucratic structures (Dubash 2021). Focused national climate institutions 
to address these challenges are more likely to emerge, persist and be effective when they are consistent

renewable energy, with pressures to disinvest in the former while increasing levels of &#8216;green finance&#8217; 
(6.7.4,  15.5).  While  some  lower-carbon  technologies  have  become  competitive  (1.4.3,  2.5),  support 
remains needed for the low-emissions options have higher costs per unit of service provided than high-
emission  ones.  Lack  of financial  resources is  identified  as  a major  barrier to  the  implementation  of 
accelerated mitigation and of shifts in development pathways. Overcoming this obstacle has two major 
components. One relates to private capital. The other to public finance. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id20140"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20141">There is substantial amount of research on the redirection of private financial flows towards low-carbon 
investment and the role of financial regulators and central banks, as detailed in Chapter 15. Financial 
systems are an indispensable element of a systemic transition (Fankhauser et al. 2016; Naidoo 2020). 
Policy frameworks can re-direct financial resources towards low-emission assets and services (UNEP 
2015), mainstreaming climate finance within financial and banking system regulation, and reducing 
transaction costs for bankable mitigation technology projects (Mundaca et al. 2013; Brunner and Enting 
2014; Yeo 2019). Shifts in the financial system to finance climate mitigation and other SDGs can be 
achieved by aligning incentives and investments with multiple objectives (UNEP Inquiry 2016). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id20150"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20151">Different  approaches  have  been  explored  to  improve  such  alignment  (15.6),  from  national  credit 
policies  to  directly  green  mainstream  financial  regulations  (e.g.,  through  modifications  in  the  Basel 
rules for banks). For all approaches, an essential precondition is to assess and monitor the contribution 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20155">of financial flows to climate and sustainability goals, with better metrics that clearly link with financial 
activity (Chenet et al. 2019). Enabling the alignment of investment decision-making with achieving 
climate  and  broader  sustainability goals includes  acknowledgment  and  disclosure  of  climate-change 
related risk and of risks associated with mitigation in financial portfolios. Current disclosures remain 
far from the scale the markets need to channel investment to sustainable and resilient solutions (UNEP 
- Finance Initiative 2020; Clark et al. 2018; Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures 2019; 
IPCC 2018b). Disclosure, however, is not enough (Ameli et al. 2020). In addition, climate targets can 
be translated into investment roadmaps and financing needs for financial institutions, both at national 
and  international  level.  Financing  needs  are  usable  for  financial  institutions,  to  inform  portfolio 
allocation decisions and financing priorities (Chenet et al. 2019). At the international level, for example,

Steckel  et  al.  (2017)  conclude  that  climate  finance  could  become  a  central  pillar  of  sustainable 
development by reconciling the global goal of cost-efficient mitigation with national policy priorities. 
Without a more rapid, scaled redeployment of financing, in development trajectories that hinder the 
realisation of the global goals will be locked in (Zadek and Robins 2016). Investment might be designed 
to avoid trading off the Paris goals against other SDGs, as well as those that simultaneously reduce

stem from other  sources, although fiscal reforms are complex endeavours (4.4.1.8). For countries at 
lower income levels, foreign aid can make an important contribution to the same agenda (Kharas and 
McArthur 2019).It may also be noted that, according to estimates at the global level, military spending 
amounted  to  USD1.748  trillion  in  2012  (the  last  year  with  data),  a  figure  that  corresponded  to  2.3 
percent of GDP, 55 percent of government spending in education, and was 13 times the level of net

may  involve  conflict  resolution  and  cross-country  agreements  on  arms  limitations)  could  free  up 
considerable resources for the SDG agenda, both in the countries that reduce spending and in the form 
of ODA. The resolution of conflicts within and between countries before they become violent would 
also reduce the need for public and private spending repairing human and physical damage. The fact 
that  civil  wars  are  common  in  the  countries  that  face  the  severest  SDG  challenges  underscores  the 
importance of this issue (Collier 2007 pp.17-37).

Bolderdijk et al. 2013; Boomsma and Steg 2014), which explains the gap between awareness and action 
(&#220;nal et al. 2018). Social influences, particularly from peers, affect people&#8217;s engagement in climate 
action  (Schelly  2014).  Role  models  appear  to  have  a  solid  basis  in  people&#8217;s  everyday  preferences 
(WBGU  2011).  Social  norms  can  reinforce  individuals&#8217;  underlying  motivations  and  be  effective  in 
encouraging  sustainable  consumption  patterns,  as  many  examples  offered  by  behavioural  science 
illustrate. Social networks also influence and spread behaviours (Service et al. 2014; Clayton et al. 2015;

The research community has 
called for more &#8220;responsible innovation&#8221; (Pandza and Ellwood 2013), &#8220;open innovation&#8221; (Rauter et al. 
2019), &#8220;mission-oriented&#8221; innovation (Mazzucato and Semieniuk 2017), &#8220;holistic innovation&#8221; (Chen et 
al.  2018b),  &#8220;next-generation  innovation  policy&#8221;  (Kuhlmann  and  Rip  2018)  or  &#8220;transformative 
innovation&#8221; (Schot and Steinmueller 2018) so that innovation patterns and processes are commensurate 
to our growing sustainability challenges. There is a growing recognition that new forms of innovation 
can be harnessed and coupled to climate objectives (Fagerberg et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018). As such, 
innovation  and  sociotechnical  change  can  be  channelled  to  intensify  mitigation  via  &#8220;deliberate

</span></div><div style="" id="id20754"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20755">Innovation goes beyond technology. For example, decarbonisation in sectors with long lived capital 
stock  (such  as  heavy  industry,  buildings,  transport  infrastructure)  entail  technology,  policy  and 
financing innovations (Bataille 2020). Similarly, expanding the deployment of photovoltaics can draw 
upon policies that support specific technical innovations (e.g., to improve photovoltaics efficiency), or 
innovations in regulatory and market regimes (e.g., net-metering), to innovations in social organisation 
(e.g., community-ownership). System innovation is a core focus of the transitions literature (Grin et al. 
2010; Markard et al. 2012; Geels et al. 2017). Accelerating low carbon transitions not only involves a 
shift  of  system  elements  but  also  underlying  routines  and  rules,  and  hence  transitions  shift  the 
directionality of innovation. They hence concern the development of a new paradigm or regime that is 
more focused on solving sustainability challenges that cannot be solved within the dominant regime

</span></div><div style="" id="id20768"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20769">Several studies have pointed at the important possible contributions of grassroots innovators for the 
start-up of sustainability transitions (Seyfang and Smith 2007; Smith et al. 2016; Seyfang et al. 2014). 
In particular, a range of studies have shown that users can play a variety of roles in promoting system 
innovation: shielding, nurturing (including learning, networking and visioning) and empowering the 
niches in relation to the dominant system and regime (Schot et al. 2016; Randelli and Rocchi 2017; 
Meelen et al. 2019). More fundamentally, innovation regimes can be led and guided by markets driven 
by monetizable profits (as much of private sector led technological innovation of patentable intellectual 
property), or prioritise social returns (e.g., innovation structures such as innovation prizes, public sector 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20778">innovation, investments in human capital, and socially-beneficial intellectual property regimes). In both 
cases, public policies can play a key role by providing resources and favourable incentives (IEA 2020). 
Chapter 16 provides more details on ways to foster innovation.

<div style="" id="id20921"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20922">Looking ahead, several studies have illustrated how structural change towards sustainability could lead 
to reduced emissions intensity and higher mitigative capacity. In China, for example, the shift away 
from heavy industry (to light industry and services) has already been identified as the most important 
force limiting emissions growth (Guan et al. 2018), and as a major factor for future emissions (Kwok 
et al. 2018). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id20928"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20929">Overall,  Altenburg  et  al.  (2017)  argue  that  reallocation  of  capital  and  labour  from  low-  to  high-
productivity sectors&#8212;i.e., structural change&#8212;remains a necessity, and that it is possible to combine it 
with reduced environmental footprint (including, but not limited to, mitigation). They argue that this 
dual challenge calls for structural transformation policies different from those implemented in the past, 
most importantly through a &#8220;systematic steering of investment behaviour in a socially agreed direction&#8221; 
and encompassing policy coordination (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20935">limited evidence, medium agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20936">). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id20938"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20939">In order to permit progress on their SDG agendas, it is essential that countries develop visions of their 
future decarbonised sectoral production structure, including its ability to generate growth in incomes, 
employment and foreign exchange earnings. as well as the related spatial distribution of production, 
employment,  and  housing.  To  this  extent,  governance  and  institutional  capacity  matter,  such  as 
availability of tools to support long-term planning. A sectoral structure that permits strong growth is 
essential given strong associations between growth in per-capita incomes and progress on most SDGs 
(including those related to poverty; health; education; and access to water, sanitation, electricity, and 
roads; but not income equality), in part due to the fact that higher incomes provide both households and 
governments with resources that at least in part would be used to promote SDGs (Gable et al. 2015). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id20949"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20950">The  future  viability  of  sectors  will  depend  on  the  extent  to  which  they  can  remain  profitable  while 
relying on lower-carbon energy. The challenge to identify alternative sectors of growth is particularly 
acute for countries that today depend on oil and natural gas for most of their foreign exchange and 
government  revenues  (Mirzoev  et  al.  2020).  Changes  in  economic  structure  will  also  have  gender 
implications since the roles of men and women vary across sectors. For example, in many developing 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20956">countries, sectors in which women play a relatively important role, including agriculture and unpaid 
household services like collection of water and fuel wood, may be negatively affected by climate change 
(Roy 2018). It may thus be important to take complementary actions to address the gender implications 
of changes in economic structure.  
</span></div><div style="" id="id20961"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20962">Given  strong  complementarities  between  policies  discussed  above,  an  integrated  policy  approach  is 
crucial. For example, as suggested, the actions that influence the pace at which GHG emissions can be 
cut  with  political  support  may  depend  on  taxation  (including  carbon  taxes),  investments  in 
infrastructure,  spending  on  R&amp;D,  changes  in  income  distribution  (influenced  by  transfers),  and 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id20967">communication. In this light, it is important to consider the demands that alternative policy packages 
put  on  government  policy-making  efficiency  and  credibility  as  well  as  the  roles  of  other  enabling 
conditions.  In  fact,  plans  to  undertake  major  reforms  may  provide  governments  with  impetus  to

<div style="" id="id21118"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21119">Mitigation  offers  an  opportunity  to  create  additional  fiscal  space,  and  thus  to  serve  the  objectives 
outlined above, by creating a new source of revenue for the government via carbon taxation or emissions 
permit auctioning and by reducing existing expenditures via reduction in subsidies to fossil-fuel. The 
1991 tax reform in Sweden is an early example in which environmental taxation (including, but not 
limited to, fossil fuel taxation) was introduced as part of a package primarily aimed at lowering the 
marginal tax  rates  (more  than  80% at  the  time), at  reducing  other taxes,  while  keeping  most  of  the 
welfare  state.  To  do  so,  the  tax  base  was  broadened,  including  through  environmental  and  carbon 
taxation (Sterner 2007). Once in place, the carbon tax rate was substantially ramped up over time, and 
its base broadened (Criqui et al. 2019). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id21129"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21130">The  future potential for  using carbon taxation as a  way  to  provide space for  fiscal  reform  has  been 
highlighted in the so-called &#8220;green fiscal reform&#8221; literature (Vogt-Schilb et al. 2019). The potential is 
large, since only 13 percent of global GHG emissions were covered by carbon pricing schemes in 2019 
(Watts et al. 2019) and since many countries price carbon negatively by subsidising fossil fuel use, thus 
generating effects that are the opposite of those that positive carbon prices hope to promote. In 2018, 
the  global  subsidy  value  amounted  to  $427  billion,  i.e.,  some  10  times  the  payment  for  carbon  use 
(Watts et al. 2019). However, the size of the potential for creating fiscal space varies strongly across 
countries given differences in terms of current carbon prices and fuel subsidies. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id21139"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21140">The limited adoption of and political support for carbon pricing may be explained by the fact that most 
of the gains occur in the future and depend on actions across the globe, making them seem abstract and 
unpredictable, whereas the costs in the form of higher carbon prices are immediate  (Karapin 2016). 
Furthermore, the links between carbon pricing and emissions may not be clear to the public who, in 
addition, may not trust that the government will use budgetary savings according to stated plans. The 
latter  may  be  due  to  various  factors,  including  a  history  of  limited  government  commitment  and 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21147">corruption (Maestre-Andr&#233;s et al 2019 ; Withana &amp; Sirini 2016; Chadwick 2017).

(Haites  2018)  suggests  that  since  2008,  other  policies  have  probably  contributed  more  to  emission 
reductions than carbon taxes, and most tax rates are too low to achieve mitigation objectives. Emissions 
under ETSs have declined, with the exception of four systems without emissions caps (ibid). Every 
jurisdiction with an ETS and/or carbon tax also has other policies that affect its GHG emissions.

<div style="" id="id21300"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21301">The timing of carbon pricing reforms is also important: they are more likely to succeed if they exploit 
windows of opportunity provided by events that raise awareness of the costs of carbon emissions (like 
bouts of elevated local air pollution or reports about the role of emissions in causing global warming), 
as  well as momentum  from  climate actions  by other  countries and international  climate  agreements 
(Karapin 2016; Jakob et al 2019). It is also important to consider the level of international prices of 
carbon  energy:  when  they  are  low,  consumer  resistance  would  be  smaller  since  prices  will  remain 
relatively low, though the tax may become more visible when energy prices increase again. As part of 
ongoing efforts to accelerate mitigation, such tax hikes may be crucial to avoid a slow-down in the shift 
to renewable energy sources (Rentschler and Bazilian 2017; Withana &amp; Sirini 2016). In countries that 
exports carbon energy, carbon taxation may run into additional resistance from producers. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id21312"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21313">There is also considerable literature providing insights on the political and social acceptability of carbon 
taxes, suggesting for example that political support may be boosted if the revenue is recycled to the tax 
payers  or  earmarked  for  areas  with  positive  environmental  effects  (e.g.,  (Bachus  et  al.  2019)  for 
Belgium,  and  (Beiser-McGrath  and  Bernauer  2019)  for  Germany  and  the  USA),  as  well  as  on  the 
difficulties associated with political vagaries (and economic consequences thereof) associated with the 
introduction of such instruments (Pereira et al. 2016). Similarly, &#8220;best practice&#8221; have been drawn from 
past experience on fossil-fuel subsidy reforms (Sovacool 2017; Rentschler and Bazilian 2017). Specific 
policies, however, depend on societal objectives, endowments, structure of production, employment, 
and trade, and institutional structure (including the functioning of markets and government capacity) 
(Kettner et al. 2019). As noted in Section 4.2.6, macroeconomic analysis finds that the overall economic 
implications of carbon pricing differ markedly depending on the way the proceeds from carbon pricing 
are used, and thus on the way the fiscal system is reformed, with potential for double dividend if the 
proceeds from the tax are used to repeal the most distortive taxes in the economy. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id21327"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21328">In the context of this section on development pathways, it is worth emphasising that potential revenues 
drawn from the climate mitigation component of the fiscal reform varies strongly with the context, and 
may  not  be  sufficient  to  address  the  other  objectives  pursued.  Even  if  the  carbon  price  is  high,  the 
revenue it generates may be moderate as a share of GDP and eventually it will be zero if emissions are 
eliminated. For example, Jakob et al. (2016) find that the carbon pricing revenues that most countries 
in Sub-Saharan Africa could expect to generate only would meet a small part of their infrastructure 
spending needs. In Sweden, the country with the highest carbon tax rate in the world, the tax has not 
been a significant part of total tax revenues. Moreover, emissions from sectors covered by the tax have 
shrunk and, as a result, the revenues from the tax, as a share of GDP, have also declined, from a peak 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21338">of 0.93 percent in 2004, when the rate was USD109 per metric ton of CO</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id21339">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21340">, to 0.48 per cent in 2018, 
when  the rate  had reached  USD132  (Jonsson  et  al.  2020;  Statistics  Sweden  2020).  This  means that

</span></div><div style="" id="id21485"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21486">The spatial distribution of households and firms across urban and rural areas is a central characteristic 
of development pathways. Patterns of urbanisation, territorial development, and regional integration 
have wide-ranging implications for economic, social and environmental objectives (World Bank 2009). 
Notably, choices regarding spatial forms of development have large-scale implications for demand for 
transportation and associated GHG emissions. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id21492"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21493">Exclusionary  mechanisms  such  as  decreasing  accessibility  and  affordability  of  inner-urban 
neighbourhoods  is  a  major  cause  of  suburbanisation  of  low-  to  middle-income  households  (e.g., 
(Hochstenbach and Musterd 2018). Suburbanisation, in turn, is associated with higher transportation 
demand (Bento et al. 2005) and higher carbon footprints for households (Jones and Kammen 2014). 
Similarly,  other  studies  find  a  significant  positive  link  between  housing  prices  and  energy  demand 
(Lampin et al. 2013). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id21500"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21501">Reducing emissions from transport in cities through traditional climate policy instruments (e.g., through 
a carbon tax) is more difficult when inner-urban neighbourhoods are less accessible and less affordable, 
because exclusionary mechanisms act as a countervailing force to the rising transportation costs induced 
by the climate policy, pushing households outwards rather than inwards. Said differently, the costs of 
mitigating intra-city transportation emissions are higher when inner-urban housing prices are higher 
(Lampin et al. 2013). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id21508"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21509">This suggests that policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more affordable 
can  open  up  broader  opportunities  for  suburban  households  to  relocate  in  the  face  of  increasing 
transportation costs. This is particularly important for low- and middle-income households, who spend 
a greater portion of their income on housing and transportation, and are more likely to be locked into 
locations that are distant from their jobs. Making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and more 
affordable has the potential to reduce both the social costs&#8212;e.g., households feeling helpless in front 
of rising fuel prices&#8212;and the economic costs of mitigation policies&#8212;as a lower price of carbon is likely 
to achieve the same amount of emission reductions since households have more capacities to adjust. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id21518"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21519">Making  inner-cities  neighbourhoods  more  accessible  and  more  affordable  is  a  complex  endeavour 
(Benner and Karner 2016). At the same time, it is already a policy objective in its own right in many 
countries, independent of the climate mitigation motivation, for a range of social, health and economic 
reasons. Revenues derived from climate policies could provide additional resources to support such 
programs, as some climate policy already have provisions to use their revenues towards low-income 
groups (Karner and Marcantonio 2018). The mitigation benefits of keeping inner-cities more accessible 
and affordable for low- and middle-income households often remains out of, or is only emerging in the 
debates surrounding the planning of fast-developing cities in many developing countries (Grant 2015; 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21528">IADB  2012;  Khosla  and  Bhardwaj  2019).  Finally,  from  a  political  economy  perspective,  it  is  also 
interesting to note that (Bergquist et al. 2020) find higher support for climate policy packages in the 
U.S. when affordable housing programs are included.

<div style="" id="id21666"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21667">Many investments in infrastructure and sectoral capital stocks have long lifetimes. Given this, it may 
be important to make sure that today&#8217;s investments be fully decarbonised at the start or that they later 
can be converted to zero carbon. Today&#8217;s investments in electric vehicles in settings where electricity 
is produced with fossil fuels is an example of convertible investments&#8212;they will be decarbonised once 
electricity  production  has  switched  to  renewable  energies.  For  capital  stocks  that  cannot  be 
decarbonised, countries may face costs of decommissioning well before the end of their useful lifetimes, 
especially when it is needed to respect country commitments to future full decarbonisation.

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21681">A  growing  literature  assesses  co-benefits  of  sectoral  policies  that  lead  to  decarbonisation  and 
simultaneously promote economic development, improve living standards, reduce inequality, and create 
job opportunities (Bataille et al. 2018; Pye et al. 2016; Maroun and Schaeffer 2012; Richter et al. 2018; 
Bataille  et  al.  2016b;  La  Rovere  et  al.  2018;  Waisman  et  al.  2019).  While  this  may  be  particularly 
challenging  in  developing  countries,  given  large  populations  still  lacking  basic  needs,  previous 
development paths show that finding synergies in development and climate objectives in the AFOLU 
sector is possible. One example is Brazil, which has arguably shifted its development pathway to reduce 
emissions and make progress towards several SDGs, though progress is not linear. Over the past two 
decades, Brazil had made remarkable progress in implementing a sequence of policies across multiple 
sectors.  This  policy  package  simultaneously  increased  minimum  wages  of  low  income  families, 
achieved universal energy access, and raised the quality of life and well-being for the large majority of 
the population (Da Silveira Bezerra et al. 2017; Grottera et al. 2018, 2017; La Rovere et al. 2018). This 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21694">led to significant social benefits, reduction of income inequality and poverty eradication (Da Silveira 
Bezerra et al. 2017; Grottera et al. 2017), reflected in a decrease of the Gini coefficient and a rise in the 
human development index (La Rovere 2017).

policies  reinforced  environmental  regulation  and  command-and-control  instruments  to  limit 
deforestation rates and implemented market-based mechanisms to provide benefits to those protecting 
local  ecosystems  and  enhancing  land-based  carbon  sinks  (Sunderlin  et  al.  2014;  Hein  et  al.  2018;

<div style="" id="id21841"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21842">In more recent years, some of these shifts in Brazil&#8217;s development pathways were undone. Political 
changes  have  redefined  development  priorities,  with  higher  priority  being  given  to  agricultural 
development  than  climate  change  mitigation.  The  current  administration  has  reduced  the  power  of 
environmental  agencies  and  forestry  protection  laws (including the  forest  code),  while  allowing the 
expansion of cropland to protected Amazon rainforest areas (Ferrante and Fearnside 2019; Rochedo et 
al. 2018). As a result, in 2020, deforestation exceeded 11,000 km</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 6px;" id="id21848">2</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21849">, and reached the highest rate in the 
last  12  years  (INPE  2020).  The  literature  cautions  that,  if  current  policies  and  trends  continue,  the 
Amazon may reach an irreversible tipping point beyond which it will be impossible to remediate lost 
ecosystems  and  restore  carbon  sinks  and  indigenous  people  knowledge  (Nobre  2019;  Lovejoy  and 
Nobre  2018;  INPE  2019a).  In  addition,  fossil  fuel  subsidies  and  other  fiscal  support  of  increased 
exploitation  of  oil  resources  may  create  carbon  lock-ins  that  further  inhibit  low-carbon  investments 
(Lef&#232;vre et al. 2018). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id21857"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21858">Brazil&#8217;s  progress  in  mitigation  depended  significantly  on  reduced  deforestation  in  the  past.  If 
deforestation rates keep on rising, mitigation efforts would need to shift to the energy sector. However, 
according to Rochedo et al. (2018), mitigation costs in the energy sector in Brazil are three times the 
costs of reducing deforestation and increasing land-based carbon sinks. Further mitigation strategies 
may depend on CCS in Brazil as elsewhere (Nogueira de Oliveira et al. 2016; Herreras Mart&#237;nez et al. 
2015), though the economic feasibility of deployment is not yet clear (4.2.5.4).
