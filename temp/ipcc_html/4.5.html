</span><div style="" id="id23122"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23123">Equity is an ethical and at times economic imperative, but it is also instrumentally an enabler of deeper 
ambition for accelerated mitigation (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). The literature supports a range of 
estimates of the net benefits&#8212;globally or nationally&#8212;of low-carbon transformation, and it identifies a 
number  of  difficulties  in  drawing  definitive  quantitative  conclusions  (e.g.,  comparisons  of  costs  &amp; 
benefits  among  different  actors,  the  existence  of  non-economic  impacts,  comparison  across  time, 
uncertainty  in  magnitude,  3.6).  One  of  the  most  important  of  these  dimensions  is  the  distributional 
consequences of mitigation, as well as a range of equity considerations arising from the uncertainty in 
net benefits, as well as from the distribution of costs and benefits among winners and losers (Rendall 
2019; Caney 2016; Lahn and Bradley 2016; Lenferna 2018a; Kartha et al. 2018b; Robiou Du Pont et 
al.  2017).  Some  equity  approaches  are  even  just  seeking  corrective  justice  including  for  historical 
emissions (Adler 2007). For an assessment of literature on fairness in NDCs, see 4.2.2.7. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id23135"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23136">Equity issues are often discussed in the literature via frameworks that are well-founded in the ethical 
literature and that have a strong bearing on effort-sharing, but have not yet been quantitatively modelled 
and expressed in the form of an emissions allocation quantified framework. These include, for example, 
ethical perspectives based in human rights (Johl and Duyck 2012), human capabilities (Klinsky et al. 
2017b), environmental justice (Mohai et al. 2009; Schlosberg 2009), ecological debt (Srinivasana et al. 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23142">2008; Warlenius  et al. 2015),  transitional justice  (Klinsky  2017;  Klinsky  and  Brankovic  2018),  and 
planetary boundaries (H&#228;yh&#228; et al. 2016).  
</span></div><div style="" id="id23145"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23146">While there is extensive literature on equity frameworks for national emissions allocations (CSO Equity 
Review  2018,  2015,  2017;  Kemp-Benedict  et  al.  2018;  Pye  et  al.  2020;  Robiou  du  Pont  and 
Meinshausen 2018; Fyson et al. 2020; Holz et al. 2018; Pozo et al. 2020), such studies have tended to 
focus on allocation of a global carbon budget among countries based on quantified equity frameworks. 
The implicit normative choices made in these analysis have limitations (Kartha et al. 2018a). Moreover, 
there  are  many  ethical  parameters  that  could  be  introduced  to  enrich  the  existing  quantitative 
frameworks,  such  as  progressivity  (Holz  et  al.  2018),  consumption-based  accounting  (Afionis  et  al. 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23154">2017),  prioritarianism  (Adler  and  Treich  2015),  and  a  right  to  development  (Moellendorf  2020). 
Introducing these ethical frames into conventional quantification approaches generally implies greater 
allocations for poorer and lower-emitting populations, suggesting that the approaches that are typically

Broader, more inclusive sharing of costs and burdens is seen as a way to enhance equity in procedures 
and outcomes. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id23346"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23347">Ultimately, equity consequences depend on how costs and benefits are initially incurred and how they 
are  shared  as  per  social  contracts  (Combet  and  Hourcade  2017),  national  policy,  and  international 
agreements. The literature suggests a relationship between the effectiveness of cooperative action and 
the perception of fairness of such arrangements. Winkler et al. (2018) demonstrate that countries have 
put forward a wide variety of indicators and approaches for explaining the fairness and ambition of their 
NDCs, reflecting the broader range of perspectives found in the moral philosophical literature cited 
above. Mbeva and Pauw (2016) further find that adaptation and financing issues take on greater salience 
in the national perspectives reflected in the NDCs. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id23356"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23357">Topics of equity and fairness have begun to receive a greater amount of attention within the energy and 
climate literature, namely through the approaches of gender and race (Pearson et al. 2017; Lennon 2017; 
Allen et al. 2019), climate justice (Roberts and Parks 2007; Routledge et al. 2018) (Roberts &amp; Parks, 
2006; Routledge et al. 2018), and energy justice (Sovacool and Dworkin 2014). While such approaches 
frequently envision justice and equity as an ethical imperative, justice also possesses the instrumental 
value of enabling deeper and more socially acceptable mitigation efforts (Klinsky and Winkler 2018). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id23364"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23365">A concrete focal point on these issues has been that of &#8220;just transition&#8221;. Getting broad consensus for the 
transformational changes entailed in moving from a high- to a low-carbon economy means &#8216;leaving no 
one  behind&#8217;,  i.e.,  ensuring  (sufficiently)  equitable  transition  for  the  relevant  affected  individuals, 
workers, communities, sectors, regions and countries (Newell &amp; Mulvaney, 2013; Jasanoff 2018). The 
concept of a &#8220;just transition&#8221; owes its origin to the US trade union movement of the 1980s. The earliest 
version of a just transition was called the &#8220;Superfund for Workers&#8221; modelled on the 1980 Superfund 
program that designed federal funds for the clean-up of toxic substances from chemicals, mining and 
energy production (Stevis and Felli 2015). It was further taken up, for example in the collaboration of 
the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC), the International Labour Organization (ILO) and 
the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) in promoting &#8220;green jobs&#8221; as integral elements of a just 
transition (ILO 2015; Rosemberg 2015). In recent years the concept of a &#8220;just transition&#8221; has gained 
increased traction, for  example  incorporated  in  the  outcome of the  Rio+20  Earth  Summit and more 
recently  recognised  in  the  preamble  of  the  Paris  Agreement,  which  states  &#8220;the  imperative  of  a  just 
transition  of  the  workforce  and  the  creation  of  decent  work  and  quality  jobs  in  accordance  with 
nationally  defined  development  priorities&#8221;  (UNFCCC  2015c).  Some  heads  of  state  and  government 
signed a </span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23381">Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23382"> first introduced at COP24 in Poland (HoSG 
2018). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id23385"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23386">The literature identifies targeted and proactive measures from governments, agencies, and authorities 
to ensure that any negative social, environmental or economic impacts of economy-wide transitions are 
minimised, whilst benefits are maximised for those disproportionally affected (Healy and Barry 2017). 
While  the  precise  definition  varies  by  source,  core  elements  tend  to  include:  (1)  investments  in 
establishing low-emission and  labour-intensive technologies and sectors  (Mijn Cha  et  al.  2020);  (2) 
research and early assessment of the social and employment impacts of climate policies  (Green and 
Gambhir  2020;  Mogomotsi  et  al.  2018);  (3)  social  dialogue  and  democratic  consultation  of  social 
partners and stakeholders (Smith 2017; Swilling and Annecke 2012); (4) the creation of decent jobs; 
active labour markets policies; and rights at work (UNFCCC 2016c; ILO 2015); (5) fairness in energy 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23396">access  and  use  (Carley  and  Konisky  2020);  (6)  economic  diversification  based  on  low-carbon 
investments;  (7)  realistic  training/retraining  programs  that  lead  to  decent  work;  (8)  gender  specific 
politics that promote equitable outcomes (Allwood 2020); (9) the fostering of international cooperation

inter-generational  justice  concerns,  such  as  the  impacts  of  policy  decisions  on  future  generations 
(Newell &amp; Mulvaney, 2013). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id23516"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23517">A  just  transition  could  therefore  entail  that  the  state  intervenes  more  actively  in  the  eradication  of 
poverty,  and  creates  jobs  in  lower-carbon  sectors,  in  part  to  compensate  for  soon-to-be  abandoned 
fossil-fuel-based sectors, and that governments, polluting industries, corporations and those more able 
to  pay  higher  associated  taxes  pay  for  transition  costs,  provide  a  welfare  safety  net  and  adequate 
compensation  for  people,  communities,  places,  and  regions  that  have  been  impacted  by  pollution, 
marginalised or negatively impacted by a transition from a high- to low-carbon economy and society 
(Muttitt and Kartha 2020; Le Billon and Kristoffersen 2020; Kartha et al. 2018b). Reducing climate 
impacts is another important dimension of equity, in that the poor who are least responsible for climate 
change  are  most  vulnerable  to  its  impacts  (WGII,  Chapter  8).</span><span style="font-family: Times; font-size: 11px;" id="id23526">  Focusing  on  financial  losses  alone 
however can obscure an important distinction between losses incurred by corporations and states and 
losses experienced by workers and communities. Processes established in the name of a just transition 
are  also  at  risk  of  being  co-opted  by  incumbent  interests  and  powerful/wealthy  agents  (Green  and 
Gambhir, 2020). Policy interventions associated with good governance, democratic oversight, and legal 
recourse  can  help  overcome  attempted  co-optation  of  just  transition,  or  use  of  COVID-19  recovery 
packages for continued carbon lock-in (Hepburn et al. 2020; SEI et al. 2020).</span></div><div style="" id="id23535"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23536">The  just  transition  concept  has  thus  become  an  international  focal  point  tying  together  social 
movements, trade unions, and other key stakeholders to ensure equity is better accounted for in low-
carbon transitions and to seek to protect workers and communities. It also forms a central pillar of the 
growing movement for a &#8216;Green New Deal&#8217;&#8212;a roadmap for a broad spectrum of policies, programs, 
and legislation that aims to rapidly decarbonises the economy while significantly reducing economic 
inequality (Galvin and Healy 2020)(Allam et al. 2021) The US Green New Deal Resolution (Ocasio-
Cortez 2019) for example positions structural inequality, poverty mitigation, and a just transition at its 
centre. The European Green Deal proposed in 2019 (European Commission 2019), including a UDF100 
billion &#8220;Just Transition Mechanism&#8221; to mitigate the social effects of transitioning away from jobs in 
fossil based industries. National level green new deals with strong just transition components have been 
proposed in South Korea, Australia, Spain, UK, Puerto Rico, Canada, as well as regional proposals 
across Latin America and the Caribbean (Pollin 2020). .
