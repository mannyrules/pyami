</span></div><div style="" id="id12102"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12103">Overall, the literature shows that pathways considered consistent with likely below 2&#730;C or 1.5&#730;C (see 
Box  4.2)&#8212;including  inter alia  80%  reduction  of  GHG  emissions  in  2050  relative  to  1990  or  100% 
renewable electricity scenarios&#8212;are technically feasible (Esteban et al. 2018; Esteban and Portugal-
Pereira 2014; Lund and Mathiesen 2009; Young and Brans 2017; Mathiesen et al. 2011; Hansen et al. 
2019; Child et al. 2019). They entail increased end-use energy efficiency, significant increases in low-
carbon energy, electrification, other new and transformative technologies in demand sectors, adoption 
of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to reduce gross emissions, and contribution to net negative 
emissions through carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and carbon sinks. For these pathways to be realized, 
the literature assumes higher carbon prices, combined in policy packages with a range of other policy 
measures.

follows. First, energy efficiency, conservation, and reducing energy use in all energy demand sectors 
(buildings, transport, and industry) are included in nearly all literature that addresses future demand 
growth (Jiang et al. 2016; Saveyn et al. 2012; Hanaoka and Masui 2018; Thepkhun et al. 2013; Chilvers

</span></div><div style="" id="id12334"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12335">Similarly, electrification of industrial processes (up to 50% for EU and China) and transport (e.g., 30-
60% for trucks in Canada), buildings, and district heating and cooling are commonplace (Ashina et al.

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12503">Power generation could decarbonise much faster with scaled up deployment of renewable energy and 
storage. Both technologies are mature, available, and fast decreasing in costs, more than for many other 
mitigation  options.  Models  continuously  underestimate  the  speed  at  which  renewables  and  storage 
expand. Higher penetration of renewable energy in the power sector is a common theme in scenarios. 
Some studies provide cost optimal electricity mix under emission constraints, while others explicitly 
explore a 100% renewables or 100% emission free electricity sector (Box 4.3). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id12510"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12511">Figure 4.3 shows an increasing share of renewable electricity in most countries historically, with further 
increases  projected  in  many  decarbonisation  pathways.  Targets  for  very  high  shares  of  renewable 
electricity  generation&#8212;up  to  100%&#8212;are  shown  for  a  number  of  countries,  with  the  global  share 
projected to range from 60% to 70% for 1.5&#176;C with no overshoot (C0) to below 2&#176;C (C4) scenarios. 
Countries  and  States  that  have  set  100%  renewables  targets  include  Scotland  for  2020  (Scottish 
Government 2021), Austria (2030), Denmark (2035) and California (2045) (Figure 4.3).  
</span></div><div style="" id="id12518"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id12519">While 100% renewable electricity generation by 2050 is found to be feasible, it is not without issues. 
For example, (Jacobson et al. 2017, 2019) find it feasible for 143 countries with only a 9% average 
increase in economic costs (considering all social costs) if annual electricity demand can be reduced by 
57%. Others state that challenges exist with speed of expansion, ensuring sufficient supply at all times 
or  higher  costs  compared  to  other  alternatives  (Clack  et  al.  2017).  In-depth  discussion  of  net  zero 
electricity systems can be found in section 6.6.

(including imports), and synthetic hydrocarbons, but will require significant increases in transmission

widely, 40% in (Hodson et al. 2018; Jayadev et al. 2020), more than half renewable and nuclear in 
(Victor et al. 2018) to 100% in (Jacobson et al. 2017, 2019).

issues related to socio-political acceptance&#8212;, and rather point to very ambitious increase in renewable 
energy, which in turn could pose significant challenges in systematically integrating renewable energy 
into the current energy systems (Viebahn et al. 2014; Mathur and Shekhar 2020). Some limitations of 
CCS, including uncertain costs, lifecycle and net emissions, other biophysical resource needs, and social

generation does not tend to associate with significantly lower carbon emissions (Sovacool et al. 2020). 
Unlike other energy sources such as wind and PV solar, levelized costs of nuclear power has been rising 
in the last decades (Portugal-Pereira et al. 2018; Gilbert et al. 2017; Grubler 2010). This is mainly due 
to overrun of overnight construction costs related to delays in project approvals and construction, and 
more  stringent  passive  safety  measures,  which  increases  the  complexity  of  systems.  After  the 
Fukushima Dai-Ichi accident in Japan, nuclear programs in several countries have been phased out or 
cancelled (Carrara 2020; Huenteler et al. 2012; Kharecha and Sato 2019; Hoffman and Durlak 2018).

policymakers&#8217; interest in this variable. It must be noted upfront that computable equilibrium models, 
on which our assessments are mostly based, capture the impact of mitigation on GDP and other core 
economic variables while typically overlooking other effects that may matter (like improvements in air 
quality). Second, even though GDP (or better, GDP per capita) is not an indicator of welfare (Fleurbaey 
and Blanchet 2013), changes in GDP per capita across countries and over time are highly correlated 
with changes in welfare indicators in the areas of poverty, health, and education (Gable et al. 2015). 
The mechanisms linking mitigation to GDP outlined below would remain valid even with alternative 
indicators of well-being (5.2.1). Third, another stream of literature criticises the pursuit of economic 
growth as a goal, instead advocating a range of alternatives and suggesting modelling of post-growth

constraint  imposes  reduced  use  of  a  production  factor  (fossil  energy),  thus  reducing  GDP.  In  the 
simulations, the mechanism at work is that firms and households reduce their use of GHG-intensive 
goods and services in response to higher prices due to reduced fossil energy use. Second, additional 
investment required for mitigation partially crowds out productive investment elsewhere (Fujimori et 
al.  2019),  except  in  Keynesian  models  in  which  increased  public  investment  actually  boosts  GDP 
(Pollitt et al. 2015; Bulavskaya and Reyn&#232;s 2018; Landa Rivera et al. 2016). Magnitude and duration 
of GDP loss depend on the stringency of the carbon constraint, the degree of substitutability with less-
GHG-intensive  goods  and  services,  assumptions  about  costs  of  low-carbon  technologies  and  their 
evolution over time (e.g., (Duan et al. 2018; van Meijl et al. 2018; Cui et al. 2019) and decisions by 
trading partners, which influence competitiveness impacts for firms (Alton et al. 2014; Fragkos et al.

market (Devarajan et al. 2011) and other areas may increase impacts of mitigation on GDP. In the mid-
term,  on  the  other  hand,  physical  and  human  capital,  technology,  institutions,  skills  or  location  of 
households and  activities  are  more flexible.  The  development  of renewable  energy  may help  create 
more employment and demands for new skills, particularly in the high-skill labour market (Hartley et 
al. 2019). In addition, cumulative mechanisms such as induced technical change or learning by doing 
on low-emissions technologies and process may reduce the impacts of mitigation on GDP.

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15088">Numerous studies have analysed the potential impact of carbon pricing on labour markets. Chateau et 
al. (2018) and OECD (2017a) find that the implementation of green policies globally (defined broadly 
as  policies  that  internalise  environmental  externalities  through  taxes  and  other  tools,  shifting 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15092">profitability from polluting to green sectors) need not harm total employment, and that the broad skill 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15094">composition (low-, high- and medium-skilled jobs) of emerging and contracting sectors is very similar, 
with the largest shares of job creation and destruction at the lowest skill level. To smoothen the labour 
market  transition,  they  conclude  that  it  may  be  important  to  reduce  labour  taxes,  to  compensate 
vulnerable households, and to provide education and training programs, the latter making it easier for 
labour to move to new jobs. Consistent with this, other studies that simulate the impact of scenarios 
with more or less ambitious mitigation policies (including 100% reliance on renewable energy by 2050) 
find  relatively  small  (positive  or  negative)  impacts  on  aggregate  global  employment  that  are  more 
positive if labour taxes are reduced but encompass substantial losses for sectors and regions that today 
are  heavily  dependent  on  fossil  fuels  (Arndt  et  al.  2013;  Huang  et  al.  2019;  Vandyck  et  al.  2016; 
Jacobson et al. 2019).  Among worker categories, low-skilled workers tend to suffer wage losses as they 
are  more  likely  to  have  to  reallocate,  something  that  can  come  at  a  cost  in  the  form  of  a  wage  cut 
(assuming that workers who relocate are initially less productive than those who already work in the 
sector). The results for alternative carbon revenue recycling schemes point to trade-offs: a reduction in 
labour  taxes  often  leads  to  the  most  positive  employment  outcomes  while  lump-sum  (uniform  per-
capita) transfers to households irrespective of income yield a more egalitarian outcome. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id15110"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15111">The  results  from  country-level  studies  using  CGE  models  tend  be  similar  to  those  at  global  level. 
Aggregate employment impacts are small and may be positive especially if labour taxes are cut, see 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15114">e.g., (Telaye et al. 2019) for Ethiopia, (Kolsuz and Yeldan 2017) for Turkey, (Fragkos et al. 2017) for 
the  EU,  (Mu  et  al.  2018b)  for  China.  On  the  other  hand,  sectoral  reallocations  away  from  fossil-
dependent sectors may be substantial, see e.g., (Alton et al. 2014) for South Africa or  (Huang et al. 
2019) for China. Targeting of investment to labour-intensive green sectors may generate the strongest 
employment  gains,  see,  e.g.,  (Perrier  and  Quirion  2018)  for  France,  (van  Meijl  et  al.  2018)  for  the 
Netherlands, (Patrizio et al. 2018) for the USA. Changes in skill requirements between emerging and 
declining sectors appear to be quite similar, involving smaller transitions than during the IT revolution 
(Bowen et al. 2018).

First,  the  price  increase  in  energy-intensive  goods  and  services&#8212;including  food  (Hasegawa  et  al. 
2018)&#8212;associated with mitigation may affect poorer households disproportionally (Bento 2013), and 
increase the number of energy-poor (Berry 2019). Second, the mitigation may disproportionally affect 
low-skilled  workers  (see  previous  section).  Distributional  issues  have  been  identified  not  only  with 
explicit price measures (carbon tax, emission permits system, subsidy removal), but also with subsidies 
for renewables (Borenstein and Davis 2016), and efficiency and emissions standards (Davis and Knittel 
2019; Bruegge et al. 2019; Levinson 2019; Fullerton and Muehlegger 2019). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id15281"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15282">Distributional implications, however, are context specific, depending on consumption patterns (initially 
and ease of adjusting them in response to price changes) and asset ownership (see for example analysis 
of energy prices in Indonesia by Renner et al. (2019)). In an analysis of the distributional impact of 
carbon pricing based on household expenditure data for 87 low- and middle-income countries, Dorband 
et  al.    (2019)  find  that,  in  countries  with  a  per-capita  income  of  up  to  USD15,000  per  capita  (PPP 
adjusted), carbon  pricing  has  a  progressive impact  on  income  distribution and that there may  be  an 
inversely U-shaped relationship between energy expenditure shares and per-capita income, rendering 
carbon  pricing  regressive  in  high-income  countries,  i.e.,  in  countries  where  the  capacity  to  pursue 
compensatory policies tends to be relatively strong. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id15311"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15312">Distributional  concerns  related  to  climate  mitigation  are  also  prevalent  in  developed  countries,  as 
demonstrated, for instance, by France&#8217;s recent yellow-vest movement, which was ignited by an increase 
in carbon taxes. It exemplifies the fact that, when analysing the distributional effects of carbon pricing, 
it is not sufficient to consider vertical redistribution (i.e., redistribution between households at different 
incomes  levels  but  also  horizontal  redistribution  (i.e.,  redistribution  between  households  at  similar 
incomes which is due to differences in terms of spending shares and elasticities for fuel consumption). 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id15319">Compared  to  vertical  redistribution,  it  is  more  difficult  to  devise  policies  that  effectively  address 
horizontal redistribution (Douenne 2020; Cronin et al. 2019; Pizer and Sexton 2019). However, it has 
been shown ex post that transfer schemes considering income levels and location could have protected 
or  even  improved  the  purchasing  power  of  the  bottom  half  of  the  population  (Bureau  et  al.  2019).

households to reduce fossil fuel consumption when prices increase (cf. Section 4.4.1.5 and 4.4.1.9). 
Similarly, in relation to energy use in housing, policies that encourage investments that raise energy 
efficiency for low-income households may complement or be an alternative to taxes and subsidies as a 
means of simultaneously mitigating and reducing fuel poverty (Charlier et al. 2019). From a different 
angle, public acceptance of the French increase in the carbon tax could also have been enhanced via a 
public information campaign could have raised public acceptance of the carbon tax increase (Douenne 
and Fabre 2020). (See section 4.4.1.8 for a discussion of this and other factors that influence public 
support for carbon taxation.).
