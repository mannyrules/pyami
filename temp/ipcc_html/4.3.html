</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16020">The  term  development  pathway  is  defined  in  various  ways  in  the  literature,  and  these  definitions 
invariably refer to the evolution over time of a society&#8217;s defining features. A society&#8217;s development 
pathway can be described, analysed, and explained from a variety of perspectives, capturing a range of 
possible  features,  trends,  processes,  and  mechanisms.  It  can  be  examined  in  terms  of  specific 
quantitative  indicators,  such  as  population,  urbanisation  level,  life  expectancy,  literacy  rate,  GDP, 
carbon dioxide emission rate, average surface temperature, etc. Alternately, it can be described with 
reference  to  trends  and  shifts  in  broad  socio-political  or  cultural  features,  such  as  democratisation, 
liberalisation,  colonisation,  globalisation,  consumerism,  etc.  Or,  it  can  be  described  in  a  way  that 
highlights  and  details  a  particular  domain  of  interest;  for  example,  as  an  &#8220;economic  pathway&#8221;, 
&#8220;technological  pathway&#8221;,  &#8220;demographic  pathway&#8221;,  or  others.  Any  such  focused  description  of  a 
pathway is more limited, by definition, than the general and encompassing notion of a development 
pathway.

</span></div><div style="" id="id16404"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16405">The SDGs provide a lens on diverse national and local development objectives. Humankind currently 
faces  multiple  sustainability  challenges  that  together  present  global  society  with  the  challenge  of 
assessing, deliberating, and attempting to bring about a viable, positive future development pathway. 
Ecological sustainability challenges include reducing GHG emissions, protecting the ozone, controlling 
pollutants such as aerosols and persistent organics, managing nitrogen and phosphorous cycles, etc. 
(Steffen  et  al.  2015),  which  are  necessary  to  address  the  rising  risks  to  biodiversity  and  ecosystem 
services on which humanity depends (IPBES 2019a). Socioeconomic sustainability challenges include 
conflict, persistent poverty and deprivation, various forms of pervasive and systemic discrimination and 
deprivation, and socially corrosive inequality. The global adoption of the SDGs and their underlying 
indicators (United Nations 2018) reflect a negotiated prioritisation of these common challenges.

and  power  structures  that  govern  decision  making,  the  institutions  and  incentives  that  guide  and 
constrain socio-technical innovation, and the norms and information platforms that shape knowledge

developmental  goals,  which  can  be  facilitated  by  policy  coherence  and  integration  with  broader 
objectives and policies sectorally and societally. This is supported by other observations that mitigation

(Pradhan et al. 2017; Nilsson et al. 2016; Weitz et al. 2018; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019). Addressing them 
calls  for  interventions  affecting  fundamental,  interconnected,  structural  features  of  global  society 
(International  Panel on  Social  Progress  2018;  TWI2050  -  The  World in  2050 2018),  such  as to  our 
physical  infrastructure  (e.g.,  energy,  water,  industrial,  urban  infrastructure)  (Thacker  et  al.  2019; 
Adshead et al. 2019; Waage et al. 2015; Mansell et al. 2019; Chester 2019), our societal institutions 
(e.g., educational, public health, economic, innovation, and political institutions)  (Sachs et al. 2019; 
Ostrom  2010;  Kl&#228;y  et  al.  2015;  Messner  2015),  and  behavioural  and  cultural  tendencies  (e.g., 
consumption patterns, conventional biases, discriminatory interpersonal and intergroup dynamics, and 
inequitable power structures) (Esquivel 2016; Sachs et al. 2019). These observations imply that attempt 
to  address  each  SDG  in  isolation,  or  as  independent  technical  challenges,  would  be  insufficient,  as 
would incremental, marginal changes. In contrast, effectively addressing the SDGs is likely to mean 
significant  disruption  of  long-standing  trends  and  transformative  progress  to  shift  development 
pathways  to  meet  all  the  SDGs,  including  climate  action,  beyond  incremental  changes  targeted  at 
addressing  mitigation  objectives  in  isolation.  In  other  words,  mitigation  conceived  as  incremental 
change is not enough. Transformational change has implications for equity in its multiple dimensions 
(Leach et al. 2018; Klinsky et al. 2017a; Steffen and Stafford Smith 2013) including just transitions

</span></div><div style="" id="id16949"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16950">Development priorities are reflected in the decisions that actors within societies make, such as policy 
choices by governments and parliaments at all levels, votes over competing policy platforms by citizens, 
or selection of issues that non-state actors push for. Multiple objectives range from poverty eradication 
to providing energy access, addressing concerns of inequality, providing education, improving health, 
cleaning air and water, improving connectivity, sustaining growth and providing jobs, among others. 
For example, eradicating poverty and reducing inequality is a key development priority across many 
countries, such as Brazil (Grottera et al. 2017), Indonesia (Irfany and Klasen 2017), India (GoI, 2015), 
South  Africa  (Winkler  2018)  and  other  low-  and  middle-income  countries  (Dorband  et  al.  2019). 
Reducing inequality relates not only to income, but also to other dimensions such as in access to energy 
services (Tait 2017), gender, education, racial and ethnic profiles (Andrijevic et al. 2020), and thereby 
assumes relevance in both developing and developed countries. The development priorities of many 
poor  countries  and  communities  with  low  capacities  to  adapt,  has  been  focused  more  on  reducing 
poverty,  providing  basic  infrastructure,  education  and  improving  health,  rather  than  on  mitigation 
(Chimhowu et al. 2019). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id16980"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16981">A systematic assessment of 107 national development plans and 10 country case studies provides useful 
insights regarding the type and content of the plans (Chimhowu et al. 2019). development plans are 
increasingly focusing on mobilising action across multiple actors and multiple dimensions to enhance 
resilience and improve the ability to undertake stronger mitigation actions. Various initiatives such as 
the  World  Summit  for  Children  in  1990;  the  Heavily  Indebted  Poor  Country  initiative  that  started 
offering debt relief in exchange for commitments by beneficiary states to invest in health, education, 
nutrition and poverty reduction in 1996; and push towards Comprehensive Development Frameworks 
seem to have catalysed the development of national actions plans across countries to estimate, measure 
and track investments and progress towards SDGs. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id16991"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16992">The most recent development plans also tend to differ from the earlier ones in terms of their approach. 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id16994">Complexity  science  has  over  the  years  argued  for  new  forms  of  planning  based  on  contingency, 
behaviour change, adaptation and constant learning (Colander and Kupers 2016; Ramalingam, 2013), 
and  new  plans  have  increasingly  focused  on  increasing  resilience  of  individuals,  organisations  and 
systems (Hummelbrunner and Jones, 2013). Finally, alongside short-term (typically 5 year) plans with 
operational purpose, countries have also expressed visions of their development pathways over longer 
time horizons, via, e.g., Voluntary National Reviews submitted in the context of the UN High Level 
Political Forum on Sustainable Development. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id17002"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17003">National development plans are also increasingly more holistic in their approach, linking closely with 
SDGs and incorporating climate action in their agendas. For instance, the Low Carbon Development 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17006">Initiative (LCDI), launched in 2017 by the Government of Indonesia, seeks to identify the development 
policies  that  can  help  Indonesia  achieve  multiple  (social,  economic,  and  environmental)  goals 
simultaneously along with preserving and improving the country&#8217;s natural resources (Bappenas 2019).

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17336">Analysis in the mitigation literature often frames mitigation policy as having development co-benefits, 
the main objective being climate stabilisation. This misses the point that development drives emissions, 
and not vice versa, and it is the overall development approach and policies that determine mitigation 
pathways (Munasinghe 2007). A large body of literature supports the fact that development pathways 
have direct and, just as importantly, indirect implications for GHG emissions (Nakicenovic et al. 2000; 
Winkler 2017b), through multiple channels, such as the nature of economic activity, spatial patterns of 
development, degree of inequality, and population growth. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id17378"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17379">Looking  ahead,  choices  about  the  nature  of  economic  activities  are  expected  to  have  significant 
implications for emissions. For example, a development pathway that focuses on enhancing economic 
growth based on manufacturing is likely to lead to very different challenges for mitigation compared to 
one that focuses on services-led growth. (Qu&#233;r&#233; et al. 2018) find that choices about whether or not to 
export  offshore  oil  in  Brazil  will  have  significant  implications  for  the  country&#8217;s  GHG  emissions. 
Similarly, in China, transforming industrial structure towards tertiary sectors (Kwok et al. 2018) and 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17386">restructuring  exports  towards  higher  value-added  products  (Wu  et  al.  2019)  are  expected  to  have

urban dwellers which in turn leads to increased personal carbon footprints and overall emissions (2.4). 
Urbanisation, and more broadly spatial patterns of development, are in turned driven to a large part by 
development  choices,  such  as,  inter  alia,  spatial  provision  of  infrastructure  and  services,  choices 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17400">regarding the agriculture and forestry sector, land-use policies, support to regional/local development,

access to modern energy services to poor populations across the globe has negligible implications for 
emissions growth, existing studies on the role of poverty and inequality as drivers of GHG emissions 
provide limited evidence that under certain contexts greater inequality can lead to a deterioration in 
environmental quality and may be associated with higher GHG emissions (2.4). In fact, factors affecting 
household  consumption  based  emissions  include  household  size,  age,  education  attainment, 
employment status, urban vs rural location and housing stock (Druckman and Jackson 2015). There is 
evidence to indicate that at the household level, the increase in emissions from additional consumption 
of  the  lower  income  households  could  be  larger  than  the  reduction  in  emissions  from  the  drop  in 
consumption from the high income households (Sager 2019). Accordingly, as countries seek to fulfil 
the objective of reducing inequality, there are possibilities of higher increase in emissions (Sager 2019).  
</span></div><div style="" id="id17565"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17566">The  Illustrative  Mitigation  Pathways  (IMP)  developed  for  this  Report  (Box  3.1  and  section  3.2.5) 
provide  another  example  of  how  development  pathways  influence  mitigative  capacity.  Precisely, 
IMP1.5-SP (Shifting Pathways) and 1.5-Ren (Renewables) lead to the same long-term temperature, but 
differ  in  underlying  socio-economic  conditions.  The  former  is  based  on  Shared  Socio-economic 
Pathway (SSP) 1 (sustainable development), whereas the latter is based on SSP 2 (middle of the road). 
Comparing 1.5-Ren to 1.5-SP can thus be interpreted as a numerical translation of trying the reach the 
same  long-term  temperature  goal  without  and  with  shifting  development  pathways  towards 
sustainability. Data shows that the global price of carbon necessary to remain on target is 40%-50% 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17575">lower  in  the  latter  relative  to  the  former,  thus  indicating  that  mitigation  is  cheaper  with  a  shift  in 
development pathway towards sustainability. Other cost indicators (e.g. consumption loss or GDP loss) 
tell the same story. Since both IMPs were computed using the same underlying model, the comparison 
is even more robust.   
</span></div><div style="" id="id17580"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id17581">In  sum,  development  pathways  can  lead  to  different  emission  levels  and  different  capacities  and

examine  enabling  conditions  for  shifting  development  pathways  (see  4.4.1);  re-evaluating  the  neo-
classical assumptions within most models, both on the functioning of markets and on the behaviour of 
agents,  to  better  address  obstacles  on  the  demand  side,  obstacles  on  the  supply  side  and  market 
distortions  (Ekholm  et  al.  2013;  Staub-Kaminski  et  al.  2014;  Grubb  et  al.  2015)  improving 
representation of issues related with uncertainty, innovation, inertia and irreversibility within the larger 
development contexts, including energy access and security ; improving the representation of social and 
human capital, and of social, technological and governance innovations (Pedde et al. 2019).

Back-casting  is  a  normative 
approach  where  modellers  construct  desirable  futures  and  specify  upfront  targets  and  then  find  out 
possible pathways to attain these targets (IPCC et al. 2001). Use of approaches like back-casting are 
useful not only in incorporating the long term national development objectives in the models, but also 
evaluating conflicts and synergies more effectively (van der Voorn et al. 2020). In back casting, the 
long-term national development objectives remain the key benchmarks guiding the model dynamics 
and  the  global  climate  goal  is  interfaced  to  realise  the  co-benefits.  The  models  then  delineate  the 
roadmap  of  national  actions  such  that  the  national  goals  are  achieved  with  a  comprehensive 
understanding of the full costs and benefits of low carbon development (often including the costs of 
adaptation  and  impacts  from  residual  climate  change).  Back-casting  modelling  exercises  show  that

various national contexts fits such a mold. In the US, for example, major government investments in 
agricultural  innovation  through  the  creation  of  agricultural  universities  and  support  for  research 
provided advances in the technological basis for modernization. A network of agricultural extension 
services accelerated the popularization and uptake of modern methods. Infrastructure investments in 
irrigation and drainage made production more viable, and investment in roadways and rail for transport 
supported market formation. Agricultural development banks made credit available, and government 
subsidies improved the profitability for farmers and agricultural corporations. Public campaigns were 
launched to modify food habits (Ferleger 2000).

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18479">In the present report, development pathways refer to patterns of development resulting from multiple 
decisions and choices made by many actors in the national and global contexts. Each society whether 
in  the  Global  North  or  the  Global  South  follows  its  own  pattern  of  development  (Figure 1.6). 
Development pathways can also be described at smaller scales (e.g., for regions or cities). By extension, 
the concept can also be applied to sectors and systems (e.g., the development pathway of the agricultural 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18485">sector or of industrial systems).

to reduce emissions 
</span></div><div style="" id="id18699"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18700">In  the  absence  of  shifts  in  development  pathways,  conventional mitigation  policy  instruments  (e.g., 
carbon tax, emission quotas, technological norms, etc.) may not be able to limit emissions to a degree 
sufficient for deep decarbonisation or only at very high economic and social costs. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id18704"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18705">Policies to shift development pathways, on the contrary, make mitigation policies more effective. For 
example, policies that prioritise non-car transit, or limit rents close to work places would make it easier 
for households to relocate in response to a price signal on transport, and thus makes the same degree of 
mitigation achievable at lower economic and social cost. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id18710"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18711">2b. Shifting development pathways broadens the scope for synergies between development objectives 
and mitigation 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18714">Second, societies pursue a variety of development objectives, of which protecting the Earth&#8217;s climate 
is part. The SDGs provide a global mapping of these goals. Absent climate mitigation, our collective 
ability to achieve the SDGs in 2030 and to sustain them beyond 2030 is likely to be compromised, even 
if adaptation measures are put in place (WGII). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id18719"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18720">There are many instances in which reducing GHG emissions and moving towards the achievement of 
other development objectives can go hand in hand, in the near-, mid- and long-term (3.7, 6.7.7, 7.6.5, 
8.2, 9.8, 10.1.1, 11.5.3, 17.3) (Figures 3.40, 12.1). For example, transitions from coal-based power to 
lower-emissions  electricity  generation technologies  and  from  Internal  Combustion  Engine  to  lower-
carbon transport has large mitigation potential and direct benefits for health through reduction in local 
air pollution (Box 6.2, 10.4.1). Energy efficiency in buildings and energy poverty alleviation through 
improved access to clean fuels also delivers significant health benefits (9.8.1 and 9.8.2).  
</span></div><div style="" id="id18728"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18729">Careful design of mitigation policies is critical to achieving these synergies (13.8). Integrated policies 
can support the creation of synergies between climate change goals and other SDGs. For example, when 
measures  promoting  walkable  urban  areas  are  combined  with  electrification  and  clean  renewable 
energy, there are several co-benefits to be attained (5.2, Figure SPM.8). These include reduced pressures

</span></div><div style="" id="id18837"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18838">Prioritising is one way to manage trade-offs, addressing some national development objectives earlier 
than others. Another way is to adopt policy packages aimed at shifting development pathways towards 
sustainability  as  they  expand  the  range  of  tools  available  to  simultaneously  achieve  multiple 
development  objectives,  including mitigation.  In  the city  example  of  section  2a,  a  carbon  tax alone 
would run counter to other development objectives if it made suburban households locked into high 
emissions transport modes poorer or if it restricted mobility choices, in particular for low- and middle-
income households. Policy packages combining affordable housing and provision of safe low-carbon 
mobility  could  both  facilitate  equitable  access  to  housing  (a  major  development  objective  in  many 
countries) and make it easier to mitigate by shifting the urban development pathway. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id18848"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18849">Similarly, a fundamental shift in the service provision that helps reduce energy demand (Chapter 5), 
driven  by  targeted  policies,  investment  and  enabling  socio-cultural  and  behavioural  change,  would 
reduce  pressure  on  supply  side  mitigation  need,  hence  limiting  pressure  on  water  and  food  and  the 
achievement of associated SDGs. Some studies assume Western European lifestyle as a reference for 
the  global  North  and  an  improvement  in  the  living  standard  for  the  Global  South  to  reduce  energy 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18855">demand and emissions (e.g., (Grubler et al. 2018)), while others explore a transformative change in the 
global North to achieve a decent living standard for all (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020; Bertram et al. 
2018) (3.7.8). For example, in the UK, interaction between multiple behavioural, socio-cultural, and 
corporate drivers including NGO campaigns, social movements and product innovations resulted in an 
observed decline in meat consumption (5.4, 5.6.4).

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id18864">Shifting  development  pathways  towards  sustainability  implies  making  transformative  changes  that 
disrupt existing developmental trends. Such choices would not be marginal (Stern and Professor 2009),

responsible investments, just transitions and shifts in behaviour and norms to support shifts away from 
fossil-fuel consumption (Green and Denniss 2018). Adopting multi-level governance modes, tackling 
corruption where it inhibits shifts to sustainability, and improving social and political trust are also key 
for aligning and supporting long-term environmentally just policies and processes.

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19071">Shifting development paths is complex. If history is any guide, practices that can easily supplant existing 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19073">systems  and  are  clearly  profitable  move  fastest  (Griliches  1957).  Changes  that  involve  &#8216;dissimilar, 
unfamiliar and more complex science-based components&#8217; take more time, acceptance and legitimation 
and  involve  complex  social  learning  (Conley  and  Udry  2010),  even  when  they  promise  large  gains 
(Pezzoni et al. 2019). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id19078"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19079">Yet despite the complexities of the interactions that result in patterns of development, history also shows 
that societies can influence the direction of development pathways based on choices made by decision-
makers,  citizens,  the  private  sector  and  social  stakeholders.  For  example,  fundamentally  different 
responses  to  the  first  oil  shock  shifted  then-comparable  economies  on  to  different  energy  sector 
development and economic pathways in the 1970s and 80s (Sathaye et al. 2009). More recent examples 
have shown evidence of voluntary transitions for e.g., advanced lighting in Sweden, improved cook-
stoves in China, liquefied petroleum gas stoves in Indonesia or ethanol vehicles in Brazil  (Sovacool 
2016).  
</span></div><div style="" id="id19088"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19089">There is no one-size-fits-all recipe for shifting development pathways. However, the following insights 
can be drawn from past experience and scenarios of possible future development pathways (4.4.1).</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19092">For 
example, policies making inner-urban neighbourhoods more accessible and affordable reduce transport 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19095">costs for low- and middle-income households, and also reduce transport emissions (4.4.1.9). Shifts in 
development  pathways  result  from  both  sustained  political  interventions  and  bottom-up  changes  in 
public opinion. No single sector or policy action is enough to achieve this. Coordinated policy mixes 
would need to coordinate multiple actors &#8211; i.e., individuals, groups and collectives, corporate actors, 
institutions  and  infrastructure  actors  &#8211;  to  deepen  decarbonisation  and  shift  pathways  towards 
sustainability (Pettifor 2020). One example was the LPG Subsidy ("Zero Kero") Program in Indonesia 
which  harnessed  creative  policy  design  to  shift  to  cleaner  energy  by  overcoming  existing  private 
interests. The objective of decreasing fiscal expenditures on domestic kerosene subsidies by replacing 
it  with  LPG  was  achieved  by  harnessing  distribution  networks  of  existing  providers  supported  by 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19105">government subsidized provision of equipment and subsidized pricing (Cross-Chapter Box 9). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id19107"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19108">Shifts in one country may spill over to other countries. Collective action by individuals as part of formal 
social movements or informal lifestyle changes underpins system change (5.2.3, 5.4.1, 5.4.5.3, 13.5).

</span></div><div style="" id="id19183"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19184">Sectoral transitions that aspire to shift development pathways often have multiple objectives, and deploy 
a  diverse  mix  or  package  of  policies  and  institutional  measures  (Figure  13.6).  Context  specific 
governance conditions can significantly enable or disable sectoral transitions, and play a determinative 
role  in  whether  a  sectoral  transition  leads  to  a  shift  in  development  pathway.  For  example,  if 
implemented policies to tackle fuel poverty target the most socially vulnerable households, this can help 
address barriers poor households face in undertaking building retrofits. In the EU-28, it has been shown 
that  accelerated  energy  efficiency  policies  coupled  with  strong  social  policies  targeting  the  most 
vulnerable households, can help reduce the energy demand in residential sector, and deliver additional 
co-benefits of avoided premature deaths and reduced health impacts (9.8.2).

could advance deeper transformations. These might include the globally declining costs of renewables 
(Fig.1.7, 2.2.5, Box 16.2), emerging social norms for climate mitigation (Green and Denniss 2018), or 
the COVID-19 pandemic, all of which might be harnessed to centre political action on protecting human 
and planetary health (B&#252;chs et al. 2020), but if not handled carefully could also risk to undermine the 
support for transformation. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id19217"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19218">5. How can shifts in development pathways be implemented by actors in different contexts? 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19220">Shifting development pathways to increased sustainability is a shared aspiration. Yet since countries 
differ in starting points (e.g., social, economic, cultural, political) and history, they have different urgent 
needs  in  terms  of  facilitating  the  economic,  social,  and  environmental  dimensions  of  sustainable 
development and, therefore, give different priorities (4.3.2, 17.4). The appropriate set of policies to shift 
development pathways thus depends on national circumstances and capacities. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id19226"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19227">In  some  developed  countries  and  communities,  affluence  leads  to  high  levels  of  consumption  and 
emissions across sectors (Wiedmann et al. 2020; Mazur and Rosa 1974). For some countries, reducing 
consumption can reduce emissions without compromising on wellbeing. However, some developing 
countries  still  face  the  challenge  of  escaping  &#8220;middle-income  traps&#8221;  (Ag&#233;nor  and  Canuto  2015),  as 
labour-saving  technological  change  and  globalisation  have  limited  options  to  develop  via  the 
manufacturing  sector  (Altenburg  and  Rodrik  2017).  In  least  developed  countries,  infrastructure, 
industry, and public services are still being established, posing both a challenge to financial support to 
deploy  technologies,  and  large  opportunities  to  support  accelerating  low-to-zero  carbon  options 
(especially in terms of efficient and sufficient provision, (Millward-Hopkins et al. 2020)). Availability 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id19237">of  capital,  or  lack  thereof,  is  a  critical  discriminant  across  countries  and  requires  international 
cooperation (15.2.2).

intentional change &#8211; to greater or lesser degrees and over longer or shorter time scales &#8211; based on a
