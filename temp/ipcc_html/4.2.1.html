national efforts to reduce GHG emissions and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Every 
five  years,  collective  progress  will  be  compared  against  long-term  goals  of  the  Paris  Agreement. 
Considering  the  outcome  of  a  global  stocktake,  countries  will  prepare  subsequent  NDCs,  showing 
progression in their ambition and enhancing international cooperation (UNFCCC 2015a).

increased ambition in addressing climate change. Moreover, though some countries like China have not 
submitted their updated NDCs yet, they have already announced their updated NDC goals somewhere. 
Countries will take the first stock in 2023 based on their progression towards achieving the objectives 
of Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015a, 2018a; SB Chairs 2021) (14.3.2.5).

</span></div><div style="" id="id2097"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2098">Most first NDCs cover all specific sectors, including LULUCF, and communicate specific targets for 
individual sub-sectors to support their overall mitigation targets. Concrete actions and priority areas are 
more detailed in the energy sector, with increased share of renewable energies and energy efficiency 
being  highlighted  in  the  majority  of  NDCs.  Given  the  uncertainty  behind  LULUCF  emission  and 
removal accounting (Grassi et al. 2017; Jian et al. 2019), several countries state that their accounting 
framework will only be defined in later NDCs. The GHG included and the global warming potentials 
(GWPs)  used  to  aggregate  emissions  also  vary  across  NDCs.  Most  countries  only  refer  to  carbon 
dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions aggregated based on IPCC AR2 or AR4 metrics, while 
few NDCs also include fluorinated gases and use IPCC AR5 GWPs. The shares of Parties that indicate 
possible use of at least one type of voluntary cooperation and set qualitative limits on their use  have 
both nearly doubled in new or updated NDCs. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id2110"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2111">There  is  considerable  literature  on  country-level  mitigation  pathways,  including  but  not  limited  to

particular,  there  is  a  growing  literature  on  (I)NDCs,  with  a  wide  scope  which  includes  estimate  of 
emissions levels of NDCs (see section 4.2.2.2); alignment with sustainable development goals (Caetano 
et al. 2020; Campagnolo and Davide 2019; Fuso Nerini et al. 2019; Antwi-Agyei et al. 2018); ambition 
(H&#246;hne  et  al.  2018;  Vogt-Schilb  and  Hallegatte  2017;  Hermwille  et  al.  2019);  energy  development 
(Scott et al. 2018); and the legality of downgrading NDCs (Rajamani and Brunn&#233;e 2017). Other studies 
note that many NDCs contain single-year mitigation targets, and suggest that a multi-year trajectory is 
important for more rigorous monitoring (Elliott et al. 2017; Dagnet et al. 2017). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id2123"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id2124">The literature also points out that beyond the &#8216;headline numbers&#8217;, information in (I)NDCs is difficult to 
analyse  (Pauw  et  al.  2018).  Information  for  &#8216;clarity,  transparency  and  understanding&#8217;  is  to  be 
communicated  with  NDCs,  although  initial  guidance  was  not  specific  (UNFCCC  2014).  While  the 
adoption of the Paris rule-book provided some greater specificity (UNFCCC 2018b,c), the information 
included  in  the  NDCs  remains  uneven.  Many  NDCs  omit  important  mitigation  sectors  and  do  not 
adequately provide details on costs and financing of implementation (Pauw et al. 2018). Countries are

has been criticised as insufficiently rigorous (Winkler et al. 2018).
