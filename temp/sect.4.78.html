or  superior  to  those  of  an  emissions-intensive  future.</span>
  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1111">  Cost  reductions  in  key  technologies, 
particularly in electricity and light-duty transport, have increased the economic attractiveness of near-
term low-carbon transitions. Long-term mitigation costs are not well understood and depend on policy 
design  and  implementation,  and  the  future  costs  and  availability  of  technologies.  Advances  in  low-
carbon  energy  resources  and  carriers  such  as  next-generation  biofuels,  hydrogen  produced  from 
electrolysis, synthetic fuels, and carbon-neutral ammonia would substantially improve the economics 
of net zero energy systems. (</span>
