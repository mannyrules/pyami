</span><div style="" id="id22805"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22806">Shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation are complex endeavours that carry risks. 
Some of these risks can be easily captured by quantitative models. Others are better understood via 
qualitative  approaches,  such  as  qualitative  narrative  storylines  (told  in  words)  and  methods  mixing 
qualitative and quantitative models (Kemp-Benedict 2012; Hanger-Kopp et al. 2019). The following 
outline key risks and relevant hedging strategies identified in the literature. 
</span></div><div style="" id="id22812"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22813">4.4.3.1</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-BoldItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22815">Actions by others not consistent with domestic efforts 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22817">The international context is a major source of uncertainty for national-level planning, especially for 
small- or medium-sized open economies, because the outcome of domestic choices may significantly 
depend on decisions made by other countries and actor, over which national governments have limited 
or no control (Lachapelle and Paterson 2013). Availability of foreign financial resources in countries 
with limited domestic savings (Baum et al. 2017) and availability of technology transfers (Glachant and 
Dechezlepr&#234;tre 2017) are some examples. Other external decisions with significant bearing on domestic 
action include mitigation policies in other countries (Dai et al. 2017), and especially in major trading 
partners, the lack of which can result in competitive disadvantage for sectors exposed to international 
competition (Alton et al. 2014). The international prices of the key commodities (notably energy), goods 
and services are important, notably when shifting development pathway is based on structural change 
(e.g., Willenbockel et al. (2017) for Ghana and Kenya). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id22829"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22830">Remedies include first devising policy packages that are, to the extent possible, robust to uncertainty 
regarding  external  decisions.  For  example,  mitigation  in  the  building  sector  is  considered  less 
problematic  for  competitiveness  since  the  construction  sector  is  less  exposed  to  international 
competition. Remedies also include securing international cooperation to reduce the uncertainty that 
domestic decision-makers face about the international context. Shifting investments towards low-GHG 
solutions requires a combination of conducive public policies, attractive investment opportunities and 
financing  of  transitions  (15.6),  which  can  enable  shifting  development  pathways.  Cooperation  can 
generate positive spill overs through technology diffusion (13.6.6). Third, cooperation is not limited to 
governments. As discussed in section 4.2.3, international cooperative initiatives among non-State actors 
(cities,  economic  branches,  etc.)  can  also  provide  know-how,  resources  and  stable  cooperative 
frameworks that reduce uncertainty for individual actors (14.5.5).

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22847">As outlined in the examples in section 4.4.1 above, shifting development pathways and accelerating 
mitigation are complex endeavours, on which there is limited experience and know-how from the past. 
An uncertainty is that parts of these policy packages may fail, i.e., under-deliver relative to the amount 
of mitigation and of transformations initially expected. For example, France has failed to meet its 2015-
2018 carbon budget as housing retrofitting programs, in particular, have failed to deliver the expected 
amount of emission reductions (Haut Conseil pour le Climat 2019). There are two main options to tackle 
this risk. The first is to build in redundancy. The second is to anticipate that some parts of the policies 
will inevitably fail, and build-in monitoring and corrective mechanisms in a sequential decision-making 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22856">process. To this regard, building institutions that can properly monitor, learn from and improve over 
time is critical (Nair and Howlett 2017).

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22980">The  science  on  climate  change,  its  impacts  and  the  opportunities  to  mitigate  is  continuously  being 
updated. Even though decisions are no longer made &#8220;in a sea of uncertainty&#8221; (Lave 1991), we know 
that  new  information  will  come  over  time,  that  may  have  significant  bearing  on  the  design  and 
objectives of policies to shift development pathways and accelerate mitigation. New information may 
come from climate sciences (e.g., updated GWP values or available carbon budgets) (Qu&#233;r&#233; et al. 2018), 
impact sciences (e.g., re-evaluation of climate impacts associated with given emission pathways) (Ricke 
et  al.  2018)  or  mitigation  sciences  (e.g.,  on  availability  of  given  technologies)  (Lenzi  et  al.  2018; 
Giannousakis et al. 2020).  
</span></div><div style="" id="id22989"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22990">At the same time, economic and social systems are characterised by high degree of inertia, via long-
lived capital stock or urban forms  (Lecocq and Shalizi 2014), or more broadly mutually reinforcing 
physical, economic, and social constraints (Seto et al. 2016) that may lead to carbon lock-ins (Erickson 
et al. 2015). Risks associated with long-lasting fossil-fuel power plants have been the object of particular 
attention. For example, Pfeiffer et al. (2018) estimate that even if the current pipeline of power plants 
was cancelled, about 20% of the existing capacity might be stranded to remain compatible with 1.5&#176;C 
or  2&#176;C  pathways&#8212;implying  that  additional  capital  accumulation  would  lead  to  higher  sunk  costs 
associated with stranded assets (Luderer et al. 2018b; Johnson et al. 2015; Ansar et al. 2013; Kriegler 
et al. 2018). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id23000"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23001">In the presence of uncertainty and inertia (or irreversibilities), hedging strategies may be considered, 
that include selection of risk-hedging strategies and processes to adjust decisions as new information 
becomes available. The notion of hedging against risks is also prominent in the adaptation literature, as 
exemplified by the terminology of &#8220;climate resilient development&#8221; (Fankhauser and McDermott 2016) 
(WGII, Ch.18). There is also a growing literature on hedging strategies for individual actors (e.g., firms 
or investors) in the face of the uncertainties associated with mitigation (e.g., policy uncertainty or the 
associated carbon price uncertainty) (e.g., (Morris et al. 2018) or (Andersson et al. 2016)). On the other 
hand, there is often limited discussion of uncertainty and of its implication for hedging strategies in the 
accelerated  mitigation  pathway  literature.  Exceptions  include  (Capros  et  al.  2019),  who  elicit  &#8220;no-
regret&#8221;  and  &#8220;disruptive&#8221;  mitigation  options  for  the  EU  through  a  detailed  sensitivity  analysis,  and 
(Watson et al. 2015) who discuss flexible strategies for the U.K. energy sector transition in the face of 
multiple uncertainties.

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23019">As  the  current  COVID-19  crisis  demonstrates,  events  happen  that  can  derail  the  best-laid  plans. 
Unexpected events beyond the range of human experience until then are called &#8216;black swans&#8217;, given the 
expectation that all swans are white. The only point to note here is that such events may also provide 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23023">opportunities. In the COVID-19 case, for example, the experience of conducting many activities on-
line, which reduces emissions from transport, may leave an imprint on how some of these activities are 
carried out in the post-COVID-19 world. Similarly, reduced air pollution seen during the pandemics 
may increase support for mitigation and strengthen the case for climate action. However, the emissions 
implications  of  recovery  packages  depend  on  choosing  policies  that  support  climate  action  while 
addressing the socio-economic implications of COVID-19 (Hepburn et al. 2020). Governments may be 
in a stronger position to do so due to their pivotal role in assuring the survival of many businesses during 
the pandemics. Given the magnitude of recovery packages and their implications (Pollitt et al. 2021), 
choosing  the  direction  of  recovery  packages  amounts  to  choosing  a  development  pathway  (Cross-
Chapter Box 1).

</span></div><div style="" id="id23103"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id23104">As noted above, shifting development pathways and accelerating mitigation involve a broad range of 
stakeholders and decision-makers, at multiple geographical and temporal scales. They require a credible 
and trusted process for reconciling perspectives and balancing potential side-effects, managing winners 
and losers and implementing compensatory measures to ensure an inclusive just transition (Newell and 
Mulvaney 2013; Miller and Richter 2014; Gambhir et al. 2018; Diffenbaugh and Burke 2019). Such 
processes  are  designed  to  manage  the  risk  of  inequitable  or  non-representative  power  dynamics 
(Helsinki Design Lab 2014; Kahane 2019; Boulle et al. 2015). More generally, stakeholder processes 
can  be  subject  to  regulatory  capture  by  special  interests,  or  outright  opposition  from  a  variety  of 
stakeholders.  Information  asymmetry  between  government  and  business  may  shape  the  results  of 
consultative processes. Long experience of political management of change demonstrates that managing 
such risks is not easy, and requires sufficiently strong and competent institutions (Stiglitz 1998). The 
next section on Just Transition (4.5) addresses this issue.
