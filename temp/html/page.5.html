<html><body><p><span>APPROVED Summary for Policymakers IPCC AR6 WG III </span></p><p><span>global net emissions based on national GHG inventories. This difference, which has been considered in </span></p><p><span>the literature, mainly reflects differences in how anthropogenic forest sinks and areas of managed land </span></p><p><span>are defined. Other reasons for this difference, which are more difficult to quantify, can arise from the </span></p><p><span>limited representation of land management in global models and varying levels of accuracy and </span></p><p><span>completeness of estimated LULUCF fluxes in national GHG inventories. Neither method is inherently </span></p><p><span>preferable. Even when the same methodological approach is applied, the large uncertainty of CO</span><sub>2</sub><span>-</span></p><p><span>LULUCF emissions can lead to substantial revisions to estimated emissions. {Cross-Chapter Box 3 in </span></p><p><span>Chapter 3, 7.2, SRCCL SPM A.3.3} </span></p><p><span><b>B.1.3</b></span><span> Historical cumulative net CO</span><sub>2 </sub><span>emissions from 1850 to 2019 were 2400&#177;240 GtCO</span><sub>2</sub><span> (</span><span><i>high </i></span></p><p><span><i>confidence</i></span><span>). Of these, more than half (58%) occurred between 1850 and 1989 [1400&#177;195 GtCO</span><sub>2</sub><span>], and </span></p><p><span>about 42% between 1990 and 2019 [1000&#177;90 GtCO</span><sub>2</sub><span>]. About 17% of historical cumulative net CO</span><sub>2</sub></p><p><span>emissions since 1850 occurred between 2010 and 2019 [410&#177;30 GtCO</span><sub>2</sub><span>]. [FOOTNOTE 10] By </span></p><p><span>comparison, the current central estimate of the remaining carbon budget from 2020 onwards for limiting </span></p><p><span>warming to 1.5&#176;C with a probability of 50% has been assessed as 500 Gt CO</span><sub>2</sub><span>, and as 1150 Gt CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> for </span></p><p><span>a probability of 67% for limiting warming to 2&#176;C. Remaining carbon budgets depend on the amount of </span></p><p><span>non-CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> mitigation (&#177;220 Gt CO</span><sub>2</sub><span>) and are further subject to geophysical uncertainties. Based on central </span></p><p><span>estimates only, cumulative net CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> emissions between 2010-2019 compare to about four fifths of the </span></p><p><span>size of the remaining carbon budget from 2020 onwards for a 50% probability of limiting global </span></p><p><span>warming to 1.5&#176;C, and about one third of the remaining carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit </span></p><p><span>global warming to 2&#176;C. Even when taking uncertainties into account, historical emissions between 1850 </span></p><p><span>and 2019 constitute a large share of total carbon budgets for these global warming levels [FOOTNOTE </span></p><p><span>11, 12]. Based on central estimates only, historical cumulative net CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> emissions between 1850-2019 </span></p><p><span>amount to about four fifths [FOOTNOTE 12] of the total carbon budget for a 50% probability of limiting </span></p><p><span>global warming to 1.5&#176;C (central estimate about 2900 GtCO</span><sub>2</sub><span>), and to about two thirds [FOOTNOTE </span></p><p><span>12] of the total carbon budget for a 67% probability to limit global warming to 2&#176;C (central estimate </span></p><p><span>about 3550 GtCO</span><sub>2</sub><span>). {Figure 2.7, 2.2, Figure TS.3, WG I Table SPM.2} </span></p><p><span><b>FOOTNOTE 10:</b></span><span> For consistency with WGI, historical cumulative CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> emissions from 1850-2019 are </span></p><p><span>reported using 68% confidence intervals. </span></p><p><span><b>FOOTNOTE 11: </b></span><span>The carbon budget is the maximum amount of cumulative net global anthropogenic </span></p><p><span>CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> emissions that would result in limiting global warming to a given level with a given likelihood, </span></p><p><span>taking into account the effect of other anthropogenic climate forcers. This is referred to as the total </span></p><p><span>carbon budget when expressed starting from the pre-industrial period, and as the remaining carbon </span></p><p><span>budget when expressed from a recent specified date. The total carbon budgets reported here are the sum </span></p><p><span>of historical emissions from 1850 to 2019 and the remaining carbon budgets from 2020 onwards, which </span></p><p><span>extend until global net zero CO</span><sub>2 </sub><span>emissions are reached. {Annex I: Glossary; WG I SPM} </span></p><p><span><b>FOOTNOTE 12:</b></span><span> Uncertainties for total carbon budgets have not been assessed and could affect the </span></p><p><span>specific calculated fractions. </span></p><p><span><b>B.1.4</b></span><span> Emissions of CO</span><sub>2</sub><span>&#8211;FFI dropped temporarily in the first half of 2020 due to responses to the </span></p><p><span>COVID-19 pandemic (</span><span><i>high confidence</i></span><span>), but rebounded by the end of the year (</span><span><i>medium confidence</i></span><span>). </span></p><p><span>The annual average CO</span><sub>2</sub><span>-FFI emissions reduction in 2020 relative to 2019 was about 5.8% [5.1-6.3%], </span></p><p><span>or 2.2 [1.9-2.4] GtCO</span><sub>2</sub><span> (</span><span><i>high confidence</i></span><span>).
