    <b>Close linkages between climate change mitigation, adaptation and development pathways</b>
    <span>. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>The development pathways taken by countries at all stages of economic development impact GHG </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>emissions and hence shape mitigation challenges and opportunities, which vary across countries </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>and regions. Literature explores how development choices and the establishment of enabling </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>conditions for action and support influence the feasibility and the cost of limiting emissions {1, 3, </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>4, 5, 13, 15, 16}. Literature highlights that climate change mitigation action designed and </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>conducted in the context of sustainable development, equity, and poverty eradication, and rooted </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>in the development aspirations of the societies within which they take place, will be more </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>acceptable, durable and effective {1, 3, 4, 5}. This report covers mitigation from both targeted </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>measures, and from policies and governance with other primary objectives. </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>&#8226;</span>
    <b>New approaches in the assessment</b>
    <span>. In addition to the sectoral and systems chapters {3, 6, 7, 8, </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>9, 10, 11, 12}, the report includes, for the first time in a WG III report, chapters dedicated to </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>demand for services, and social aspects of mitigation {5, Box TS.11}, and to innovation, </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>technology development and transfer {16}. The assessment of future pathways in this report covers </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>near term (to 2030), medium term (up to 2050), and long term (to 2100) timescales, combining </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>assessment of existing pledges and actions {4, 5}, with an assessment of emissions reductions, and </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>their implications, associated with long-term temperature outcomes up to the year 2100 </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>{3}.[FOOTNOTE 4] The assessment of modelled global pathways addresses ways of shifting </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>development pathways towards sustainability. Strengthened collaboration between IPCC Working </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>Groups is reflected in Cross-Working Group boxes that integrate physical science, climate risks </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>and adaptation, and the mitigation of climate change.</span>

    <b>Increasing diversity of analytic frameworks from multiple disciplines including social </b>
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>sciences.</b>
    <span> This report identifies multiple analytic frameworks to assess the drivers of, barriers to </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>and options for, mitigation action. These include: economic efficiency including the benefits of </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>avoided impacts; ethics and equity; interlinked technological and social transition processes; and </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>socio-political frameworks, including institutions and governance {1, 3, 13, Cross-Chapter Box 12 </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>in Chapter 16}. These help to identify risks and opportunities for action including co-benefits and </span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <span>just and equitable transitions at local, national and global scales. {1, 3, 4, 5, 13, 14, 16, 17} </span>
