Different datasets for GHG </span></p><p><span>emissions exist, with varying time horizons and coverage of sectors and gases, including some that go </span></p><p><span>back to 1850. In this report, GHG emissions are assessed from 1990, and CO</span><sub>2</sub><span> sometimes also from </span></p><p><span>1850.

The choice of metric depends on the purpose of the </span></p><p><span>analysis and all GHG emission metrics have limitations and uncertainties, given that they simplify the </span></p><p><span>complexity of the physical climate system and its response to past and future GHG emissions. {Chapter </span></p><p><span>2 SM 2.3, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 2, Box TS.2, WG I Chapter 7 Supplementary Material} </span></p><p><span><b>FOOTNOTE 8: </b></span><span>In this SPM, uncertainty in historic GHG emissions is reported using 90 % uncertainty </span></p><p><span>intervals unless stated otherwise.
