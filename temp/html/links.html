Coal  electricity capacity  grew  by  7.6%  between  2015 and  2019,  as  new  builds in  some  countries  offset  declines  in others. Total consumption of oil and oil products increased by 5%, and natural gas consumption grew by  15%.

The physical  infrastructure  includes  all  the  infrastructure  and  equipment  used  to  extract,  transform, transport, transmit, and convert energy to provide energy services. In addition to the physical system, a broad range of societal systems and dynamics are relevant to the energy system. Human societies use energy to transport themselves and the goods that they use and consume, to heat, cool, and light their homes, to cook their food, and to produce goods and services. Energy systems are therefore tied to the systems involved in the provision of these various goods and services. All energy users engage in the operation of energy systems by demanding energy at particular times and in particular forms. They can adjust their behaviour and demands, for example, by using less energy or by changing when they use energy.  Consumers  can  invest in  equipment  that  reduces  their  energy  needs,  and  they  can  invest  in technologies  that  transform  energy  (e.g.,  rooftop  solar)  or  store  energy  (e.g.,  batteries).  Firms  and governments invest in equipment to produce, transform, and transport energy  such as power plants, refineries, </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id1484_1">electric transmission lines</a><span>, and oil tankers. All aspects of energy systems are governed by laws, regulations, and actual institutions that reside within businesses and governments at all levels. This includes,  for example,  rules for  trading emissions  permits,  deciding  when  particular electricity generation technologies might come  online, water management and related environmental rules that </span></li></ul></li><li>energy demand profiles<ul><li><span>  into  underground  reservoirs  or  disposing  of  nuclear  waste,  and  even company  policies  regarding  work  hours  or  teleworking,  which  can  have  important  implications  for </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id1505_1">energy demand profiles</a><span>.
