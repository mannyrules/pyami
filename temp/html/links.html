In a net zero </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id24228_1">global energy system</a><span>, bioenergy trade could be greater than current trade of coal or natural gas, but less than that of petroleum (Sharmina et al. 2017) (Mandley et al, 2020). Some studies indicate that Latin America and Africa could become key exporting regions, with the EU, the USA, and East Asia emerging as key importers (Rentizelas et al. 2019; Alsaleh and Abdul-Rahim 2018). Studies have found that net bioenergy exports could be as high as 10% of GDP for some Latin American countries, while other regions like the EU may be faced with burgeoning import reliance (Mahlknecht et al. 2020; Daioglou et al. 2020b).

The physical  infrastructure  includes  all  the  infrastructure  and  equipment  used  to  extract,  transform, transport, transmit, and convert energy to provide energy services. In addition to the physical system, a broad range of societal systems and dynamics are relevant to the energy system. Human societies use energy to transport themselves and the goods that they use and consume, to heat, cool, and light their homes, to cook their food, and to produce goods and services. Energy systems are therefore tied to the systems involved in the provision of these various goods and services. All energy users engage in the operation of energy systems by demanding energy at particular times and in particular forms. They can adjust their behaviour and demands, for example, by using less energy or by changing when they use energy.  Consumers  can  invest in  equipment  that  reduces  their  energy  needs,  and  they  can  invest  in technologies  that  transform  energy  (e.g.,  rooftop  solar)  or  store  energy  (e.g.,  batteries).  Firms  and governments invest in equipment to produce, transform, and transport energy  such as power plants, refineries, </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id1484_1">electric transmission lines</a><span>, and oil tankers. All aspects of energy systems are governed by laws, regulations, and actual institutions that reside within businesses and governments at all levels. This includes,  for example,  rules for  trading emissions  permits,  deciding  when  particular electricity generation technologies might come  online, water management and related environmental rules that </span></li></ul></li><li>energy demand profiles<ul><li><span>  into  underground  reservoirs  or  disposing  of  nuclear  waste,  and  even company  policies  regarding  work  hours  or  teleworking,  which  can  have  important  implications  for </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id1505_1">energy demand profiles</a><span>. Many people are employed in the energy sector, and </span></li></ul></li><li>energy systems refer<ul><li><span> from the atmosphere. Similarly, &#8220;low-carbon&#8221; transitions is used to describe transitions that limit likely warming to 2&#176;C or below. &#8220;Net-zero&#8221; </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id1540_1">energy systems refer</a><span> to those that produce very little or no CO</span></li></ul></li><li>split roughly equally<ul><li><span> as methane), </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id1903_1">split roughly equally</a><span> between the two (IEA 2020a). There remains a high degree of uncertainty in methane emissions estimates from oil and gas operations despite the emergence of new data from satellites and other measurement campaigns. According to a recent study (Hmiel et al. 2020), methane emissions are underestimated by about 25 to 40%. </span></li></ul></li><li>global energy sector<ul><li><span>Increasing </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id1963_1">global energy sector</a><span>  GHG emissions have been driven by rising emissions in some large developing and emerging countries; however, per capita emissions in these countries remain well below those in developed countries (Yu et al. 2019).

In  some  cases,  these  energy  access  subsidies  have  helped  extend modern energy sources to the poor (Kimemia and Annegarn 2016) and thereby contribute to SDG-7. However, the subsidies have proven to be regressive in most cases, with little benefit reaching the poor (Lockwood 2015). For example, Indonesia has introduced liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) subsidies for cooking. The kerosene to LPG conversion program (&#8220;Zero Kero&#8221;) was launched in 2007 and provided mainly households with free initial LPG equipment and LPG at a low subsidized price (Thoday et al. 2018;  Imelda  et  al.  2018b).  Besides  the  national  government,  provincial  governments  and  industry played a crucial role in implementation. Overall, the LPG conversion program in Indonesia reduced cooking kerosene use (Andadari et al. 2014; Imelda et al. 2018b) and GHG emissions (Permadi et al. 2017) with positive health effects (Thoday et al. 2018; Imelda et al. 2018b). However, the program is generally viewed as regressive and has failed to reduce traditional solid fuel use (Andadari et al. 2014; Toft 2016; Thoday et al. 2018). Furthermore, even if the program decreased </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id3937_1">greenhouse gas emissions</a><span> relative to continued kerosene use, these subsidies are still targeted at fossil fuels and contribute to GHG emissions.  </span></li></ul></li><li>emissions decreased meaningfully<ul><li><span> emissions from the energy system.

About 2.65 billion households were cooking with solid fuels, distributed across Asia and Africa (IEA et al. 2020). Around 850 million people in sub-Saharan Africa relied on traditional biomass (firewood and charcoal) for cooking, and 60 million relied on kerosene and coal to meet their energy needs (IEA 2018a). Air pollution was likely responsible for 1.1 million deaths across Africa in 2019 (Fisher et al. 2021).

Approximately  2  hectares  of  land  are  needed  for  1  MW  of  solar electricity capacity (Kabir et al. 2018; Perpi&#241;a Castillo et al. 2016); at 20% efficiency, a square of PV panels of 550 km by 550 km, comprising 0.2% of Earth&#8217;s land area, could meet </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id4806_1">global energy demand</a><span>. Land conversion can have local impacts, especially near cities and where land used for solar competes with  alternative  uses, such  as  agriculture.  Large installations  can  also adversely  impact  biodiversity (Hernandez et al. 2014), especially where the above ground vegetation is cleared and soils are typically graded. Landscape fragmentation creates barriers to the movement of species. However, a variety of means  have  emerged  to  mitigate  land  use  issues.  Substitution  among  renewables  can  reduce  land conversion (Tr&#246;ndle and Trondle 2020). Solar can be integrated with other uses through &#8216;agrivoltaics&#8217; (the use of land for both agriculture and solar production) (Dupraz et al. 2011) by, for example, using shade-tolerant crops (Dinesh and Pearce 2016).

Poland, another coal-heavy country in Europe, has not indicated a coal phaseout target and faces substantial challenges (Whitley et al. 2017; Antosiewicz et al. 2020). European efforts to phase out  coal  indicate  that  appropriate  financial  instruments  are  needed  (Rentier  et  al.  2019),  and  a  just transition for workers are important to gain broad public support and help those most affected by the phaseout (Johnstone and Hielscher 2017; Osi&#269;ka et al. 2020).  </span></li></ul></li><li>ageing coal fleets<ul><li><span>Coal use has been declining in North America.

However, there have been concerns about social and economic consequences, particularly at the local level. For instance, the U.S. has lost about 50,000 coal mining jobs between 2011 and 2021 (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021), with significant regional and economic inequities (Bodenhamer 2016; Abraham 2017; Greenberg  2018).  Comprehensive  social  programs,  such  as  retirement  compensation,  training  for reemployment, and business support for economic diversification, have been suggested as means to support a just transition (Patrizio et al. 2018; Homagain et al. 2015; Grubert 2020). </span></li></ul></li><li>inefficient coal plants<ul><li><span> Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), and new coal plants are being built at a slower rate than previously.

These efforts are largely due to non-climate reasons, such air pollution and health (Singh and Rao 2015; Gass et al. 2016; Peng et al. 2018; Malik et al. 2020), overcapacity (Blondeel and Van de Graaf 2018), and rural electrification and renewable investments (Aklin et al. 2017; Thapar et al. 2018). However,  as  new  builds  offset  retirements,  coal  generation  capacity  has  continued  to  grow  in  both countries  since  2015  (Global  Energy  Monitor  et  al.  2021).  Other  fast-growing  Southeast  Asian countries, such as Indonesia, Vietnam, and Philippines have experienced strong growth in coal use (IEA 2020b), but an increasing number of new coal power projects are being cancelled (Littlecott et al. 2021). </span></li></ul></li><li>global electricity generation<ul><li><span>.

Droughts  reduce hydroelectric electricity generation (Gleick 2016; van Vliet et al. 2016c); wind farms do not produce electricity in calm conditions or shut down in very strong winds (Petersen and Troen 2012); solar PV generation  is  reduced  by  clouds  and  is less  efficient under  extreme  heat,  dust  storms,  and  wildfires (Perry  and  Troccoli  2015; Jackson  and  Gunda  2021).  In  addition,  the  electrification  of  heating  will increase  the  weather  dependence  of  electricity  consumption  (Staffell  and  Pfenninger  2018;  Gea-Berm&#250;dez et al. 2021). Non-renewable generation, for example from nuclear and </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id20229_1">fossil power plants</a><span>, are also vulnerable to high temperatures and droughts as they depend on water for cooling (Cronin et al. 2018; Ahmad 2021). </span></li></ul></li><li>variable renewable electricity<ul><li><span>Recent years have seen a rapid decline in the cost of energy storage, particularly batteries (see Section 6.4.4).

In  2019,  10  GW  of  batteries  were  connected  at  the  grid  and consumer level, rising from 0.6 GW in 2015 (IEA 2020c; IEA WEO 2019).   </span></li></ul></li><li>battery electric vehicles<ul><li><span>The drop in battery prices has also had important implications in the transportation sector.

The main perceived advantage of fossil energy is the relatively low costs, and emphasizing these costs might increase acceptability somewhat (Pohjolainen et al. 2018; Hazboun and Boudet 2020; Boyd et al. 2019). Acceptability of fossil fuels is on average similar to acceptability of nuclear energy, although evaluations are less polarized. People evaluate natural gas as somewhat more acceptable than other fossil fuels, although they generally oppose hydraulic fracturing (Clarke et al. 2016). Yet, natural gas is evaluated as less acceptable than </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id9511_1">renewable energy sources</a><span>, although evaluations of natural gas and biogas are similar (Liebe and Dobers 2019; Plum et al. 2019). Acceptability of fossil energy tends to be higher in countries and regions that strongly rely on them for their energy production (Boyd et al. 2019; Pohjolainen et al. 2018). Combining fossil fuels with CCS can increase their acceptability (Van Rijnsoever et al. 2015; Bessette and Arvai 2018). Some people seem ambivalent about natural gas, as they perceive both benefits (e.g., affordability, less carbon emissions than coal) and disadvantages (e.g., finite resource, contributing to climate change) (Blumer et al. 2018).  </span></li><li><span>.

In 2020, 61 regional, national and sub-national carbon pricing instruments, representing 22% of the global GHG emissions, were in action or scheduled for implementation (World Bank 2019).

Most  of  the  carbon  pricing schemes have taken place in the OECD countries. The limited application of carbon pricing instruments in developing, and emerging economies may be due to political economy constraints  (Campiglio 2016; Finon 2019). Carbon pricing had a sizeable impact on emissions , e.g. the EU ETS impacts emissions from electricity in Germany (Sch&#228;fer 2019) and manufacturing in France (Colmer et al.), respectively. Emission  reductions  could  be  increased  with  higher  carbon  prices  and  without  free  allocation  of allowances.  </span></li></ul></li><li>predominantly adverse environmental<ul><li><span>Energy subsidies continue to be widely applied.

Land conversion can have local impacts, especially near cities and where land used for solar competes with  alternative  uses, such  as  agriculture.  Large installations  can  also adversely  impact  biodiversity (Hernandez et al. 2014), especially where the above ground vegetation is cleared and soils are typically graded. Landscape fragmentation creates barriers to the movement of species. However, a variety of means  have  emerged  to  mitigate  land  use  issues.  Substitution  among  renewables  can  reduce  land conversion (Tr&#246;ndle and Trondle 2020). Solar can be integrated with other uses through &#8216;agrivoltaics&#8217; (the use of land for both agriculture and solar production) (Dupraz et al. 2011) by, for example, using shade-tolerant crops (Dinesh and Pearce 2016). Combining solar and agriculture can also create income diversification, </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id4806_4">reduced drought stress</a><span>, higher solar output due to radiative cooling, and other benefits (Elamri et al. 2018; Hassanpour Adeh et al. 2018; Barron-Gafford et al. 2019). PV installations floating on water also avoid land-use conflicts (Sahu et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2020), as does dual-use infrastructure, such as landfills (J&#228;ger-Waldau 2020) and reservoirs where evaporation can also be reduced (Farfan </span></li></ul></li><li>global electronic waste<ul><li><span>accumulation. Recycling allows the reuse of nearly all - 83% in one study - of the components of PV modules,  other  than  plastics  (Ardente  et  al.  2019)  and  would  add  less  than  1%  to  lifecycle  GHG emissions (Latunussa et al. 2016). Glass accounts for 70% of the mass of a solar cell and is relatively easy to recycle. Recycling technology is advancing, but the scale and share of recycling is still small (Li et al. 2020d).

IEA runs a program to enable PV recycling by sharing best practices to minimise recycling life cycle impacts. Ensuring that a substantial  amount  of  panels  are  recycled  at  end  of  life  will  likely  require  policy  incentives,  as  the market value of the recovered materials, aside from aluminium and copper, is likely to be too low to justify  recycling  on  its  own  (Deng  et  al.  2019).

The most </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id4980_1">significant technological advance</a><span> within silicon PV in the past ten years has been the widespread adoption of the passivated emitter and rear cell (PERC) design (Green 2015), which now accounts for the majority of production.

The main challenges are raising the efficiency and  improving  their  lifetime  (Ma  et  al.  2020;  Riede  et  al.  2021).  Quantum  dots,  spherical  semi-conductor  nano-crystals,  can  be  tuned  to  absorb  specific  wavelengths  of  sunlight  giving  them  the potential for high efficiency with very little material use (Kramer et al. 2015). A common challenge for all emerging solar cell technologies is developing the corresponding production equipment. Hybrids of </span></li></ul></li><li>continuous solar resource<ul><li><span>can also be used to produce solar fuels, for example, hydrogen or synthetic gas (syngas) (Nocera 2017; Montoya et al. 2016; Detz et al. 2018). In addition, research proceeds on space-based solar PV, which takes advantage of high insolation and a </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id5133_1">continuous solar resource</a><span> (Kelzenberg et al. 2018), but faces the formidable obstacle of developing safe, efficient, and inexpensive microwave or laser transmission to the Earth&#8217;s surface (Yang et al. 2016).

A radical new class of wind energy converters has also been conceived under the name of Airborne Wind Energy Systems that can harvest strong, high-altitude winds (typically between 200&#8211;800m), which are inaccessible by traditional wind turbines (Cherubini et al. 2015).

The capacity factor for onshore wind farms increased from 27% in 2010 to 36% in 2020 (IRENA 2021a). The global average offshore capacity factor has decreased from a peak of 45% in 2017. This has been driven by the increased share of offshore development in China, where projects are often near-shore and use smaller wind turbines than  in  Europe  (IRENA  2021b).

The impacts on animal habitats and collisions can be resolved or reduced by  selectively  stopping  some  wind  turbines  in  high  risk  locations,  often  without  affecting  the productivity of the wind farm (de Lucas et al. 2012). Many countries now require environmental studies of impacts of wind turbines on wildlife prior to project development, and, in some regions, shutdowns are required during active bird migration (de Lucas et al. 2012). Offshore wind farms can also impact migratory  birds  and  other  sea  species  (Hooper  et  al.  2017).  Floating  foundations  pose  lower environmental  impacts  at  build  stage  (IRENA  2019c),  but  their  cumulative  long-term  impacts  are unclear (Goodale and Milman 2016). Recent studies find weak associations between </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id5803_1">wind farm noise</a><span> and measures of long-term human health (Poulsen et al. 2018a,b, 2019a,b).</span></li></ul></li><li>fair decision-making procedures<ul><li><span>) (e.g., Rand and Hoen 2017; Steg 2018; Bell et al. 2005; Batel and Devine-Wright 2015).

Yet, some people believe wind turbines can cause  noise  and  visual  aesthetic  pollution,  threaten  places  of  symbolic  value  (Russell  et  al.  2020; Devine-Wright and Wiersma 2020), and have adverse effects on wildlife (Bates and Firestone 2015), which challenges public acceptability (Rand and Hoen 2017).

These cost drivers fall into four categories: design maturity, project management, regulatory stability and predictability, and multi-unit  and  series  effects  (NEA  2020).  With  lessons  learned  from  first-of-a-kind  projects,  the  cost  of electricity for new builds are expected to be in the range of USD 42&#8211;102 MWh</span></li></ul></li><li>major nuclear accidents<ul><li><span>Despite low probabilities, the potential for </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id6632_1">major nuclear accidents</a><span> exists, and the </span></li><li><span>Ashworth 2013; Corner et al. 2011; Pampel 2011).

At the same time, some groups see nuclear energy as a reliable energy source, beneficial for the economy and helpful in climate change mitigation. Public support for nuclear energy is higher when people are concerned about energy security, including concerns about the availability of energy and high energy prices (Gupta et al. 2019b; Groot et al. 2013), and when they expect local benefit (Wang et al. 2020c). Public support also increases when trust in managing bodies is higher (de Groot and Steg 2011).

Although the extraction of these resources is still more expensive than those derived from conventional reservoirs, the large availability of unconventional resources has significantly reduced global prices. The emergence of liquefied natural gas (LNG) markets has also provided opportunities to export natural gas significant distances from the place of production (Avraam et al. 2020). The increase in availability of natural gas has been accompanied by an increase in the production of natural gas liquids as a co-product to oil and gas. Over the period from 2014 to 2019, exports of natural gas liquids increased by 160%.  Natural  gas  liquids  could  potentially  be  a  lower-carbon  alternative  to  liquid  fuels  and hydrocarbons.

A  fully  intelligent  and sophisticated  coordination of the  multiple  systems  through  smart  control  will  support this  paradigm shift.  This  shift  will  provide  significant  savings  through  better  utilization  of  existing  infrastructure locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally.

When deployed  with  smart  contracts,  this  concept  will  be  suitable  for  energy  systems  involving  many participants, where a prerequisite is digitalization (e.g., smart meters, end-use demand control systems) (Teufel et al. 2019; Juhar and Khaled 2018). </span></li></ul></li><li>low carbon generation<ul><li><span>Energy storage technologies make low carbon electricity systems more cost-effective, allowing VRE technologies to replace more expensive firm </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id10856_1">low carbon generation</a><span> technologies (Carbon Trust 2016) and  reducing  investment  costs  in  backup  generation,  interconnection,  transmission,  and  </span></li><li><span>Energy storage technologies can provide a range of different grid services (Table 6.5). Energy storage enhances  security  of  supply  by  providing  real  time  system  regulation  services  (voltage  support, frequency regulation, fast reserve, and short-term reserve). A greater proportion of variable renewable sources reduces system inertia, requiring more urgent responses to changes in system frequency, which rapid  response  storage  technologies  can  provide  (stability  requires  responses  within  sub  second timescale  for  provision  of  frequency  and  voltage  control  services).  Energy  storage  also  provides intermittent  renewable  sources  with  flexibility,  allowing  them  to  contribute  a  greater  proportion  of electrical energy and avoiding curtailment (capacity firming). Investment costs in backup generation, interconnection,  transmission,  and  distribution  network  upgrades  can  thus  be  reduced  (upgrade deferral), meaning that less </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id11965_1">low carbon generation</a><span> will need to be built while still reducing emissions. In the event of an outage, energy storage reserves can keep critical services running (islanding) and restart  the  grid  (black start).  The  ability to  store  and release  energy as required provides  a  range  of market opportunities for buying and selling of energy (arbitrage). </span></li></ul></li><li>distribution network upgrades<ul><li><span> technologies (Carbon Trust 2016) and  reducing  investment  costs  in  backup  generation,  interconnection,  transmission,  and  </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id10856_4">distribution network upgrades</a><span> (</span></li></ul></li><li>low carbon systems<ul><li><span>).

This  means  that  although  costs today may be relatively high, there are significant opportunities for future cost reductions, both through technology innovation and through manufacturing scale. Adding significant amounts of storage will reduce the price variation and, therefore, the profitability of additional and existing storage, increasing investment risk.  </span></li></ul></li><li>improved round-trip efficiencies<ul><li><span>Advanced pump-turbines are being developed, allowing both reversible and variable-speed operation, supporting frequency control and grid stability with </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id12266_1">improved round-trip efficiencies</a><span> (Ardizzon et al. 2014).  New  possibilities  are  being  explored  for  small-scale  PHS  installations  and  expanding  the potential for siting (Kougias et al. 2019). For example, in underwater PHS, the upper reservoir is the sea, and the lower is a hollow deposit at the seabed. Seawater is pumped out of the deposit to store off-peak energy and re-enters through turbines to recharge it (Kougias et al. 2019). Using a similar concept, underground  siting  in  abandoned  mines  and  caverns  could  be  developed  reasonably  quickly  (IEA 2020h). Storage of energy as gravitational potential can also be implemented using materials other than water, such as rocks and sand. Pumped technology is a mature technology (Barbour et al. 2016; Rehman et al. 2015) and can be important in supporting the transition to future low carbon electricity grids (IHA 2021). </span></li></ul></li><li>rechargeable battery cell<ul><li><span>There are many types of batteries, all having unique features and suitability (c), but their key feature is their rapid response times. A </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id12281_1">rechargeable battery cell</a><span> is charged by using electricity to drive ions from one electrode to another, with the reverse occurring on discharge, producing a usable electric current (Crabtree et al. 2015). While lead-acid batteries (LABs) have been widely used for automotive and grid applications for decades (May et al. 2018), li-ion batteries (LIBs) are increasingly being used in  grid-scale  projects  (Crabtree  et  al.  2015),  displacing  LABs.  The  rapid  response  time  of  batteries makes them suitable for enhanced frequency regulation and voltage support, enabling the integration of variable renewables into electricity grids (Strbac and Aunedi 2016). Batteries can provide almost all electricity services, except for seasonal storage. Lithium-ion batteries, in particular, can store energy and power in small volumes and with low weight, making them the default choice for EVs (Placke et al. 2017). EV batteries are expected to form a distributed storage resource as this market grows, both impacting and supporting the grid (Staffell and Rustomji 2016). </span></li></ul></li><li>global cradle-to-grave impacts<ul><li><span>Drawbacks of batteries include relatively short lifespans and the use of hazardous or costly materials in some variants. While LIB costs are decreasing (Schmidt et al. 2017; Vartiainen et al. 2020), the risk of thermal runaway, which could ignite a fire (Gur 2018; Wang et al. 2019a), concerns about long-term resource availability (Sun et al. 2017; Olivetti et al. 2017), and concerns about </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id12946_1">global cradle-to-grave impacts</a><span> (Peters et al. 2017; Kallitsis et al. 2020) need to be addressed. </span></li></ul></li><li>next-generation battery chemistries<ul><li><span>).

Extending  the  life  of  the  battery  can  bring  down  overall  costs  and mitigate  the  environmental  impacts  (Peters  et  al.  2017).  Understanding  and  controlling  battery degradation is therefore important. The liquid, air-reactive electrolytes of conventional LIBs are the main source of their safety issues (Gur 2018; Janek and Zeier 2016), so All-Solid-State Batteries, in which the electrolyte is a solid, stable material, are being developed.

Public  perceptions  differ  across  storage  technologies.  Hydrogen  is  considered  a  modern  and  clean technology, but people also have safety concerns. Moreover, the public is uncertain about hydrogen storage size and the possibility of storing hydrogen in or near residential areas (Eitan and Fischhendler 2021). Battery storage both on the household and community level was perceived as slightly positive in one study in the UK (Ambrosio-Albala et al. 2020). However, financial costs are seen as a main barrier.

Like hydrogen, ammonia could facilitate management of variable RES, due to its cost-effective grid-scale energy storage capabilities. In this regard, production of ammonia via hydrogen from low- or zero-carbon generation technologies along with ammonia energy recovery technologies (Afif et al. 2016) could play a major role in forming a hydrogen and/or ammonia economy to support decarbonization. However, there are serious concerns regarding the ability to safely use ammonia for all these purposes, given its toxicity - whereas hydrogen is not considered toxic. </span></li></ul></li><li>liquified natural gas<ul><li><span>Hydrogen  can  be  liquefied  and  transported  at  volume  over  the  ocean  without  pressurization.  This requires a temperature of &#8211;253&#186;C and is therefore energy-intensive and costly (Niermann et al. 2021). Once  it  reaches  its  destination,  the  hydrogen  needs  to  be  re-gasified,  adding  further  cost.  A demonstration  project  is  under  development  exporting  liquid  hydrogen  from  Australia  to  Japan (Yamashita  et  al.  2019).  Hydrogen  could  also  be  transported  as  ammonia  by  ocean  in  liquid  form. Ammonia is advantageous because it is easier to store than hydrogen  (Zamfirescu and Dincer 2008; Nam  et  al.  2018;  Soloveichik  2016).

A project exporting ammonia from Saudi Arabia to Japan is under consideration  (Nagashima  2018).  LOHCs  could  also  be  used  to  transport  hydrogen  at  ambient temperature and pressure. This advantageous property of LOHCs makes them similar to oil products, meaning they can be transported in existing oil infrastructure including oil tankers and tanks (Niermann et al. 2019; IEA 2019).

The  diurnal  and  seasonal  characteristics  of  different  renewable  energy  sources  such  as wind,  solar,  and  hydropower  can  vary  significantly  by  location.  Through  enhanced  electricity transmission infrastructure, more wind turbines can be deployed in areas with high wind potential and more solar panels in areas with larger solar irradiation. Increases in electricity transmission and trade can also enhance operational efficiency and reduce or defer the need for investment in peaking plants, storage,  or  other  load  management  techniques  needed  to  meet  security  of  supply  requirements associated  with  localized  use  of  VRE  sources.

In  general,  interconnection  is  more  cost-optimal  for  countries  that  are geographically close to each other and can benefit from the diversity of their energy mixes and usage (Schlachtberger et al. 2017). Such developments are not without price, however, and amongst other concerns, raise issues surrounding land use, public acceptance, and resource acquisition for materials necessary for renewable developments (Vakulchuk et al. 2020; Capell&#225;n-P&#233;rez et al. 2017).  </span></li></ul></li><li>largest transmission capacity<ul><li><span>Corporation of China was officially completed and put into operation.

LCOE  ranges  for  low-  and  zero-carbon  electricity technologies overlap with LCOE&#8217;s of fossil generation without CCS. For example, LCOEs for utility solar and wind today and in the future overlap with those of new coal and gas without  CCS (Figure 6.18, NREL 2021; Lazard, 2020; IEA WEO 2020, IEA WEO 2020). Some of the overlap stems from differences  in  assumptions  or  regional  conditions  that  apply  to  all  technologies  (e.g.,  variations  in assumed  discount  rates),  but  the  overlap  also  reflects  the  fact  that  low-  and  zero-carbon  electricity generation options are, and will be, less expensive than emitting options in many regions. Future cost projections also illustrate that several technologies are anticipated to experience further cost declines over  the  coming  decades,  reinforcing  the  increasingly  competitiveness  of  low-  and  zero-carbon electricity.

The marginal cost of deploying electricity sector mitigation options increases  as  electricity  emissions  approach  zero;  in  addition,  the  most  cost-effective  mix  of  system resources changes as emissions approach zero and, therefore, so do the implications of electricity sector mitigation for sustainability and other societal goals (Cole et al. 2021; Jayadev et al. 2020; Bistline et al. 2018; Mileva et al. 2016; Sepulveda et al. 2018). Key factors influencing the electricity mix include relative costs and system benefits, </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id21415_1">local resource bases</a><span>, infrastructure availability, regional integration and trade, co-benefits, societal preferences and other policy priorities, all of which vary by country and </span></li></ul></li><li>prominent electricity resources<ul><li><span>) (Figure 6.22). While wind and solar will likely be </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id21559_1">prominent electricity resources</a><span>, this does not imply that 100% renewable  energy systems will  be  pursued  under  all circumstances,  since  economic  and  operational challenges increase nonlinearly as shares approach 100% (Box 6.8) (Bistline and Blanford 2021a; Cole et al. 2021; Shaner et al. 2018; Frew et al. 2016; Imelda et al. 2018b). Real-world experience planning and  operating  regional  electricity  systems  with  high  instantaneous  and  annual  shares  of  renewable generation is accumulating, but debates continue about how much wind and solar should be included in different systems, and the cost-effectiveness of mechanisms for managing variability (Box 6.8). Either firm, dispatchable generation (including nuclear, CCS-equipped capacity, dispatchable renewables such as geothermal, and fossil units run with low capacity factors and CDR to balance emissions) or seasonal energy  storage  (alongside other  balancing resources discussed in  Box  6.8)  will  be  needed  to  ensure reliability  and  resource  adequacy  with  high  percentages  of  wind  and  solar  (Jenkins  et  al.  2018b; Dowling et al. 2020; Denholm et al. 2021) though each option involves uncertainty about costs, timing, and public acceptance (Albertus et al. 2020). </span></li></ul></li><li>long-duration energy storage<ul><li><span>). Deployment of energy storage will vary based on the system benefits and  values  of  different  options  (Arbabzadeh  et  al.  2019;  Denholm  and  Mai  2019).  Diurnal  storage options  like  lithium-ion  batteries  have  different  value  than  storing  and  discharging  electricity  over longer periods through </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id21595_1">long-duration energy storage</a><span> with less frequent cycling, which require different technologies, supporting policies, and business models  (Sepulveda et al. 2021; Dowling et al. 2020; Gallo et al. 2016; Albertus et al. 2020; Blanco and Faaij 2017) (Section 6.4.4).

These  increases  will  likely  be  accompanied  by expanded balancing regions to take advantage of geographical smoothing. </span></li><li><span>).  These  systems  require  decarbonizing  all electricity, using this zero-carbon electricity broadly, and then utilizing zero-carbon energy carriers for all  end  uses  not  served  by  electricity,  for  example,  air  travel,  long-distance  transport,  and  high-temperature  process  heat.  Broader  questions  emerge  regarding  the  attractiveness  of  supplying  all energy,  and  not  just  electricity,  with  renewables  (Figure  6.22).  Integrated  assessment  and  energy systems research suggest large roles for renewables, but energy and electricity shares are far from 100%, even with stringent emissions reductions targets and optimistic assumptions about future cost reductions (Huntington et al. 2020; Jenkins et al. 2018b; Bauer et al. 2018; Bistline et al. 2018, Section 6.7.1). Scenarios  with  100%  renewable  energy  systems  are  an  emerging  subset  in  the  decarbonization literature,  especially  at  regional  levels  (Denholm  et  al.  2021;  Hansen  et  al.  2019).  Many  100% renewables studies focus more heavily on electrification for decarbonizing end uses, and include less biofuels and hydrogen than the broader literature on deep decarbonization (Bauer et al. 2018a). These studies  typically  assume  a  constrained  set  of  available  technologies  to  demonstrate  the  technical feasibility of very </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id22003_1">high renewable systems</a><span> and do not optimize to find least-cost, technology-neutral </span></li></ul></li><li>flexible fossil units<ul><li><span>Dispatchable generation could include </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id21820_1">flexible fossil units</a><span>  or  low-carbon  fuels  such  as  hydrogen  with  lower  minimum  load  levels  (Bistline  2019; Denholm et al. 2018), renewables like hydropower, geothermal, or biomass (Hansen et al. 2019; </span></li></ul></li><li>shape demand profiles<ul><li><span>newly electrified end uses such as electric vehicles to </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id21967_1">shape demand profiles</a><span> to better match supply  (Bistline 2021a; Imelda et al. 2018a; Hale 2017; Brown et al. 2018; Ameli et al. 2017).   </span></li></ul></li><li>studies broadly agree<ul><li><span>decarbonization  pathways,  and  many  100%  renewables  studies  focus  on  the  electricity  sector  or  a limited number of sectors (Hansen et al. 2019; Jenkins et al. 2018a).  In addition to renewables, </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id22018_1">studies broadly agree</a><span> that including additional low-carbon options &#8211; including not only low-carbon electricity but also targeted use of fossil fuels with and without CCS (Section 6.6.2.1) and alternative fuels for sectors that are difficult to electrify (Section 6.6.2.4) &#8211; can lower the cost of decarbonization even with very high shares of renewables (Figure 6.22). However, there is disagreement about the magnitude of cost savings from larger portfolios, which depend on context- and scenario-specific assumptions about technologies, markets, and policies.</span></li></ul></li><li>district heating network<ul><li><span>) (Chapter 9). Space cooling and water heating are expected to be largely electrified. Building electrification is expected to rely substantially on heat pumps, which will help lower emissions both through reduced thermal requirements and higher efficiencies (Mathiesen et al. 2015; Rissman et al.; Sven et al. 2018). The level of electrification for heating  will  depend  on  the  tradeoffs  between  building  or  household  level  heat  pumps  versus  more centralized </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id22210_1">district heating network</a><span> options (Mathiesen et al. 2015; Brown et al. 2018), as well as the cost  and  performance  of  heat  pumps  in  more  extreme  climates  and  grid  infrastructure  (EPRI  2018; Waite and Modi 2020). </span></li></ul></li><li>fossil fuel inputs<ul><li><span> emissions and without </span><a href="chap6_raked.html#id22405_1">fossil fuel inputs</a><span> (Sections 6.4.4 and 6.4.5).

Given system variability and differences in regional resources,  there  are  economic  and  technical  advantages  to  greater  coordination  of  investments  and policies  across  jurisdictions,  sectors,  and  levels  of  government  (Schmalensee  and  Stavins  2017).
