Oil and gas consumption fall more slowly. Low-carbon sources produce 93% to 97% of global electricity by 2050 in scenarios that limit likely warming to 2&#176;C or  below.  In  scenarios  limiting  warming  to  1.5&#176;C  with  no  or  limited  overshoot  (likely  below  2&#176;C), electricity supplies 48% to 58% (36% to 47%) of final energy in 2050, up from 20% in 2019. </span></li><li><span> Many aspects of the energy system &#8211; physical infrastructure; institutions, laws, and regulations; and behaviour &#8211; are resistant to change  or  take  many  years  to  change.
