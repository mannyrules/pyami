  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id961">Total energy investment needs will rise, relative to today, over the next decades, if likely 
warming is limited to 2&#176;C or below. These increases will be far less pronounced, however, than the 
reallocations of investment flows that are likely to be seen across sub-sectors, namely from fossil fuels 
(extraction, conversion, and electricity generation) without CCS and toward renewables, nuclear power, 
CCS, electricity networks and storage, and end-use energy efficiency. A significant and growing share 
of investments between now and 2050 will be made in emerging economies, particularly in Asia. (</span>
