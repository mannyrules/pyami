emissions is therefore essential to limit warming. The energy systems of the future will be very different 
from  those  of  today  if  the  world  successfully  limits  warming  to  well  below  2&#176;C.  Energy  will  be 
provided, converted, and used in different ways than it is today (Figure 6.1). Achieving and responding 
to these changes presents an impressive range of challenges and opportunities.

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1332">Within this context, this chapter has two main objectives. First, it aims to assess specific, individual 
mitigation options in energy supply, energy transformation, and energy transportation and transmission. 
This assessment is complementary to a set of chapters that explore mitigation options in agriculture, 
forestry, and other land uses (Chapter 7), urban systems and other settlements (Chapter 8), buildings 
(Chapter 9), transport (Chapter 10), industry (Chapter 11), and cross-sectoral perspectives (Chapter 12). 
Second,  this  chapter  aims  to  assess  system-level  mitigation  opportunities  and  challenges  across  the 
entirety of energy systems. These systems include energy supply, transformation, transmission, storage, 
transportation,  and  end-uses.  They  also  include  the  societal  systems  that  interact  with  the  physical 
energy system. As energy systems become increasingly integrated and interconnected, a system-wide 
perspective is necessary for understanding mitigation opportunities and challenges.

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1344">Within this context, this chapter addresses six topics, each of which is addressed in a separate section. 
First, Section 6.2 defines the scope of the energy system. Section 6.3 then discusses the recent trends in 
energy systems that might exert the most significant influence on energy system evolution and options

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1348">for  reducing  emissions.  Section  6.4  assesses  the  status  and  potential  of  individual  energy  supply, 
transformation,  storage,  transportation  and  transmission,  and  integration  mitigation  options  in  the 
energy sector. Section 6.5 explores how climate change might affect energy systems and alter potential 
energy system mitigation options and strategies. Section 6.6 identifies key characteristics of net zero 
energy systems &#8211; those that emit very little or no CO</span>

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1354">. Section 6.7 explores transition pathways toward 
and through net zero energy systems. Across all of these sections, the chapter aims to explore the ways 
that  energy  sector  mitigation  options  and  strategies  interact  with  SDGs  and  other  societal  and 
environmental goals.
