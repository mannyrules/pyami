infrastructure and unburned fossil fuel resources. </span>
  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id950">The economic impacts of stranded assets could 
amount to trillions of dollars. Coal assets are most vulnerable over the coming decade; oil and gas assets 
are  more  vulnerable  toward  mid-century.  CCS  can  allow  fossil  fuels  to  be  used  longer,  reducing 
potential stranded assets. </span>
