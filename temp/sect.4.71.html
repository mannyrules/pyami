coming  decades,  but  it  will  be  challenging  to  supply  the  entire  energy  system  with  renewable 
energy.</span>
  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id987">  Large  shares  of  variable  solar  PV  and  wind  power  can  be  incorporated  in  electricity  grids 
through  batteries,  hydrogen,  and  other  forms  of  storage;  transmission;  flexible  non-renewable 
generation; advanced controls; and greater demand-side responses. Because some applications (e.g., air 
travel) are not currently amenable to electrification, 100% renewable energy systems would likely need 
to include alternative fuels such as hydrogen or biofuels. Economic, regulatory, social, and operational 
challenges increase with higher shares of renewable electricity and energy. The ability to overcome 
these challenges in practice is not fully understood. </span>
