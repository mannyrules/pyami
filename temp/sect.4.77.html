can support sustainable development goals (SDGs) and other societal objectives.</span>
  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1099"> Energy systems 
are linked to a range of societal objectives, including energy access, air and water pollution, health, 
energy  security,  water  security,  food  security,  economic  prosperity,  international  competitiveness, 
employment. These linkages and their importance vary among regions. Energy sector mitigation and 
efforts  to  achieve  SDGs  generally  support  one  another,  though  there  are  important  region-specific 
exceptions. </span>
