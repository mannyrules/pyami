    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1542">  Despite  the  drop  in  emissions  due  to  the  COVID-19  crisis,  the  gap 
between  projected  emissions  based  on  Nationally  Determined  Contributions  (NDCs)  in  2030  and 
emissions pathways compatible with the long term temperature goal set in the Paris Agreement remains 
large (4.2.2). In addition to this persistent emissions gap, we face an implementation gap, as current 
policies are insufficient to achieve mitigation targets in NDCs, and sufficient international support is 
not yet available to developing countries who have requested and quantified support needs. Continuing 
along a development pathway characterized by the same underlying drivers, structural obstacles and 
insufficient  enabling  conditions  that  led  to  high  emissions  will  not  address  the  problem  (</span>

</span>
  </div>
  <div style="" id="id1554">
    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1555">The analysis of the gap is conducted together with Chapter 3 (see Cross-Chapter Box 4). Chapter 3 is 
working backward, assessing mitigation in the long-term (beyond 2050 up to 2100) to draw the near- 
and mid-term implications of long-term temperature and mitigations goals. Chapter 4, on the other hand, 
works forward from current and planned mitigation (including NDCs) (4.2.1, 4.2.2) and from current 
development  paths  to  assess  the  implications  for  near-  and  mid-term  Greenhouse  Gases  (GHG) 
emissions and development goals. Some countries, regions, cities, communities and non-state actors are 
taking leadership in implementing more ambitious action (4.2.3). This chapter also assesses national 
low emission development strategies (4.2.4).

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1566">Technical alternatives and policy options exist to bridge the emissions and 
implementation  gaps,  and  the  literature  illustrates  these  with  a  wide  range  of  accelerated  techno-
economic  pathways  that  deepen  decarbonisation  closer  to  the  pace  and  scale  required  (4.2.5),  and 
examines their impacts on other development objectives (4.2.6). In practice, however, scaling up at the 
broader, deeper, and faster level required to meet climate goals while advancing other development 
objectives  regularly  faces  prohibitive  obstacles  (4.2.7).  Mitigation  policies  grafted  on  to  existing 
development pathways are unlikely to achieve rapid and deep emission reductions.

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1575">Secondly,  even  if  carefully  designed,  climate  policies  to  accelerate  mitigation  may  have  adverse 
consequences for other development objectives. As a complement to mitigation action, taking action to 
shift  development  pathways  towards  sustainability  broadens  the  range  of  mitigation  options,  while 
increasing the possibility to meet other development priorities at the same time (</span>

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1719"> The literature does not provide 
a  complete  handbook  for  shifting  development  pathways  and  accelerating  mitigation.  The  literature 
does, however, shed light on some of the underlying dynamics. Shifting development pathways can be 
necessitated by the existence of pervasive obstacles that prove prohibitive to reaching mitigation and 
other  development  objectives  (4.2.7).  Deliberate  measures  taken  to  facilitate  the  shifting  of 
development pathways and accelerated mitigation involve putting in place key enabling conditions that 
help  overcome  those  obstacles  (see  Figure  4.6)&#8212;improving  governance  and  institutional  capacity, 
fostering  behavioural  change  and  technological  innovation,  designing  and  implementing  adequate 
policy, and finance. Just transitions, while they will differ by context, are critical to identifying and 
avoiding or addressing inequitable distributive consequences (</span>

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1733">Enabling conditions necessary to accelerate mitigation and shift development pathways are discussed 
in depth in Chapters 5, 13, 14, 15 and 16. In addition, Chapters 13 and 14 detail the policy instruments 
that  could  help  shift  development  pathways  and  accelerate  the  scale  and  pace  of  mitigation,  while 
Chapter 4 describes those in broad strategies terms. Chapter 13 adds more texture on institutional and 
governance  machinery;  policy  choice,  design  and  implementation;  as  well  as  policy  formulation 
processes, actors and structure across scales.

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1741">Since development pathways and mitigation options depend to large extent on national objectives and 
circumstances, this chapter is primarily concerned with literature at national level (or in the case of the 
European Union, at regional level), while Chapter 3 is primarily concerned with literature at global 
scale.  The  national  scale  selected in  this  Chapter  requires  attention  as  national mitigation  pathways 
cannot be linked directly to global mitigation goals (see Box 4.2). This chapter is also concerned mostly 
with economy-wide development and mitigation pathways, as distinct from detailed sectoral work that 
is assessed in the systems chapters 6 to 12. The present chapter also assesses literature on non-state 
action.

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1751">Chapter  4  draws  on  five  major  strands  of  literature:  (1)  an  emerging  literature  on  development 
pathways&#8212;conceptual, empirical, and model-based, including at the national and sub-national scales; 
(2)  a  rapidly  expanding,  model-based,  literature  on  mitigation  pathways  in  the  near-  and  mid-term 
(Lepault and Lecocq 2021); (3) studies of NDCs and mid-century strategies; (4) a broader literature on 
transformation and shifts in development pathways, including from non-climate literatures; and (5) a 
significant literature on equity, including just transitions. This is supported by a database of country-
level mitigation scenarios at country level assembled for the preparation of this Chapter (Annex  III, 
Table I.10 and I.11).

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1761">The Chapter builds on past IPCC reports. In AR5, all mitigation pathways were assessed in a single 
chapter  (Clarke  et  al.  2014),  which  focused  mostly  on  the  long-term.  SR1.5  included  a  chapter  on 
mitigation pathways compatible with the temperature goal in the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al. 2018a), 
mostly at the global level. It also considered strengthening mitigation (de Coninck et al. 2018) in the 
context of poverty, inequality and sustainable development (Roy et al. 2018). Development pathways 
have also been explored, albeit less frequently, in past IPCC reports starting with the Special Report on 
Emissions  Scenarios  (Nakicenovic  et  al.  2000).  Some  early  framing  of  development  pathways  was 
included in the Third Assessment Report (William R. Moomaw et al. 2001), further developed in the 
Fourth Assessment Report (Sathaye et al. 2007). An extended discussion of climate change and equity

what levers are available to policy makers, and how policies may intersect with adaptation goals. It

various risks associated with shifting development pathways and accelerated mitigation strategies.

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1857">Finally,  equity  and  just  transitions  are  recurring  themes  in  the  Chapter,  specifically  in  relation  to 
accelerating mitigation  and  shifting  development  pathways  toward  sustainability.  In  section  4.2.2.7, 
equity is discussed in the context of Parties&#8217; assertions regarding the fairness of their NDCs, alongside 
reflections from academic scholarship on the ethical underpinnings of these assertions and of various 
quantitative  analyses  of  equitable  effort-sharing.  Section  4.2.6  discusses  certain  distributional 
implications of domestic mitigation efforts, such as shifts in employment. Sections 4.2.7 and 4.3 note 
the  relevance  of  potential  distributional  impacts  as  an  obstacle  to  climate  action,  as  well  as  the 
inequitable  distribution  of  decision-making  authority.  Finally,  section  4.5  recognizes  the  structural 
relationship between equity and climate, explores just transitions as an international focal point tying 
together  social  movements,  trade  unions,  and  other  stakeholders,  and  thus  an  instrumental  role  in 
establishing consensus.
