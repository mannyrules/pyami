national efforts to reduce GHG emissions and build resilience to the impacts of climate change. Every 
five  years,  collective  progress  will  be  compared  against  long-term  goals  of  the  Paris  Agreement. 
Considering  the  outcome  of  a  global  stocktake,  countries  will  prepare  subsequent  NDCs,  showing 
progression in their ambition and enhancing international cooperation (UNFCCC 2015a).

increased ambition in addressing climate change. Moreover, though some countries like China have not 
submitted their updated NDCs yet, they have already announced their updated NDC goals somewhere. 
Countries will take the first stock in 2023 based on their progression towards achieving the objectives 
of Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015a, 2018a; SB Chairs 2021) (14.3.2.5).

Baseline years vary from 1990 to 2015 and in almost all NDCs the targeted time frame is 2030, with a
