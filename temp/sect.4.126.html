</span><div style="" id="id21870"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21871">Mitigation actions are strongly linked to adaptation. These connections come about because mitigation 
actions can be adaptive (e.g., some agroforestry projects) but also through policy choices (e.g., climate 
finance is allocated among adaptation or mitigation projects) and even biophysical links (e.g., climate 
trajectories, themselves determined by mitigation, can influence the viability of adaptation projects). 
As development pathways shape the levers and enablers available to a society (4.3.1, Figure 4.7), a 
broader set of enabling conditions also helps with adaptation (</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21877">medium evidence, high agreement</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id21878">).

mitigation and adaptation as key areas of action, through NDCs and communicating adaptation actions 
and plans. The Agreement explicitly recognises that mitigation co-benefits resulting from adaptation 
can  count  towards  NDC  targets.  The  IPCC  Fifth  Assessment  Report  (IPCC  2014)  emphasised  that 
sustainable  development  is  helpful  in  going  beyond  a  narrow  focus  on  separate  mitigation  and

actions. Implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions can, however, encounter different sets of 
challenges. Mitigation actions requiring a shift away from established sectors and resources (e.g., fossil 
fuels) entail governance challenges to overcome vested interests (SEI et al. 2020; Piggot et al. 2020). 
Mitigation-focused initiatives from non-state actors tend to attain greater completion than adaptation-

but  mitigation  is  undertaken  deliberately.  Chapter  5  considers  behavioural  change,  including  the 
reconsideration of values and what is meant by well-being, and reflecting on a range of actors addressing 
both adaptation and mitigation. Shifting development pathways may be disruptive (Cross Chapter Box 
</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22081">5), and there may be limits to propensity to change. Some studies report that climate change deniers 
and sceptics can be induced to undertake pro-environmental action if those actions are framed in terms 
of societal welfare, not climate change (Bain et al. 2012; Hornsey et al. 2016). Concrete initiatives to 
change behaviour and lifestyles include the Transition Town movement, which seeks to implement a 
just transition&#8212;both in relation to adaptation and mitigation&#8212;in specific localities (Roy et al. 2018).

</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22231">Systems transitions that address both adaptation and mitigation include the widespread adoption of new 
and  possibly  disruptive  technologies  and  practices  and  enhanced  climate-driven  innovation  (IPCC 
2018a). See Chapter 16 for an in-depth discussion of innovation and technology transfer. The literature 
points  to  trade-offs  that  developing  countries  face  in  investing  limited  resources  in  research  and 
development,  though  finding  synergies in  relation  to  agriculture  (Adenle  et  al. 2015).  Other  studies 
point  to  difference  in  technology  transfers  for  adaptation  and  mitigation  (Biagini  et  al.  2014). 
Adaptation projects tend to use existing technologies whereas mitigation climate actions are more likely 
to  rely  on  novel  technologies.  Innovations  for  mitigation  are  typically  technology  transfers  from 
developed  to  less-developed  countries  (Biagini  et  al.  2014),  however  this  so-called  North-South 
technology transfer pathway is not exclusive (Biagini et al. 2014), and is increasingly challenged by 
China&#8217;s  global  role  in  implementing  mitigation  actions  (Chen  2018;  Urban  2018).  Indigenous 
knowledge  can  be  a  unique  source  for  techniques  for  adaptation  (Nyong  et  al.  2007)  and  may  be 
favoured over externally generated knowledge (Tume et al. 2019).

investment in R&amp;D of animal product substitutes (Figure 13.2) which could reduce pressure on land

other  societal  goals,  including  biodiversity  conservation  and  other  sustainable  development  goals

Indeed, there are conceptual formulations for these practices in which the co-benefits are more of a 
focus, such as climate-smart agriculture (CSA) which ties mitigation to adaptation through its three 
pillars of increased productivity, mitigation, and adaptation (Lipper et al. 2014). The &#8216;4 per 1000&#8217; goal 
to increase soil carbon by 0.4% per year (Soussana et al. 2019) is compatible with the three pillars of 
CSA. Sustainable intensification, a framework which centers around a need for increased agricultural 
production  within  environmental  constraints  also  complements  CSA  (Campbell  et  al.  2014).  The 
literature reports examples of mitigation co-benefits of adaptation actions, with evidence from various 
regions (Chapter 7, Thornton and Herrero (2015), Thornton et al. (2018)).

significant progress in this sector. The link between NDCs and mitigation in the land use sector can 
provide impetus for such policies. For example, there are multiple agricultural mitigation options that 
southeast  Asian  countries  could  use  to  meet  NDCs  that  would  have  an  important  adaptive  impact 
(Amjath-Babu et al. 2019).

negative effects on adaptation or other ecosystem services. Fast-growing tree monocultures or biofuel 
crops may enhance carbon stocks but reduce downstream water availability and decrease availability of 
agricultural  land  (Windham-Myers  et  al.  2018;  Kuwae  and  Hori  2019).  In  some  dry  environments 
similarly, agroforestry can increase competition with crops and pastures, decreasing productivity, and

However, if such a practice leads to lower yields, interconnections of the global agricultural system can

impacts of sea level rise and extreme weather along the coast line (Siikam&#228;ki et al. 2012; Roma&#241;ach et

adaptive  capacity.  While  policy  in  Brazil  has  tended  to  focus  on  the  Amazon  as  a  carbon  sink,  the 
mitigation co-benefits of ecosystem-based adaptation actions have been highlighted in the literature (Di

choices.  In  agricultural  contexts,  restoration is  a  development choice  that  can enhance  adaptive  and 
mitigative capacity via impact on farmer livelihoods.

Restoration of ecosystems is associated with improved water filtration, ground water recharge and flood 
control and multiple other ecosystem services (Ouyang et al. 2016). 
</span></div><div style="" id="id22660"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id22661">Restoration projects must be designed with care. There can be trade-offs in addition to the synergies 
noted  above  (7.6.4.3).  Restorations  may  be  unsuccessful  if  not  considered  in  their  socio-economic 
context  (Lengefeld  et  al.  2020;  Iftekhar  et  al.  2017;  Jellinek  et  al.  2019).  Restoration  projects  for 
mitigation  purposes  can  be  more  effective  if  done  with  adaptation  in  mind  (Gray  et  al.  2011)  as  a 
changing  climate  may  render  some  mitigation  actions  biophysically  infeasible  (Arneth  et  al.  2021).

carbon, or deferral of storage until after irreversible climate change effects (e.g. extinctions) (Dooley 
and Kartha 2018).

unresolved debate on the feasibility and tradeoffs of such plans. Such afforestation programs can fail 
for biophysical reasons (7.4.2.2, Fleischman et al. 2020) but also lack of consideration of socioeconomic 
and development contexts (Fleischman et al. 2020).
