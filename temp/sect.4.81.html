    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1484">For this chapter, energy systems are defined broadly to include both physical and societal elements. The 
physical  infrastructure  includes  all  the  infrastructure  and  equipment  used  to  extract,  transform, 
transport, transmit, and convert energy to provide energy services. In addition to the physical system, a 
broad range of societal systems and dynamics are relevant to the energy system. Human societies use 
energy to transport themselves and the goods that they use and consume, to heat, cool, and light their 
homes, to cook their food, and to produce goods and services. Energy systems are therefore tied to the 
systems involved in the provision of these various goods and services. All energy users engage in the 
operation of energy systems by demanding energy at particular times and in particular forms. They can 
adjust their behaviour and demands, for example, by using less energy or by changing when they use 
energy.  Consumers  can  invest in  equipment  that  reduces  their  energy  needs,  and  they  can  invest  in 
technologies  that  transform  energy  (e.g.,  rooftop  solar)  or  store  energy  (e.g.,  batteries).  Firms  and 
governments invest in equipment to produce, transform, and transport energy  such as power plants, 
refineries, electric transmission lines, and oil tankers. All aspects of energy systems are governed by 
laws, regulations, and actual institutions that reside within businesses and governments at all levels. 
This includes,  for example,  rules for  trading emissions  permits,  deciding  when  particular electricity 
generation technologies might come  online, water management and related environmental rules that

company  policies  regarding  work  hours  or  teleworking,  which  can  have  important  implications  for 
energy demand profiles. Many people are employed in the energy sector, and energy system mitigation 
will eliminate some jobs while creating others.

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1511">This broader view of energy systems is essential for understanding energy system mitigation, as these 
broader  societal  and  institutional  factors  can  have  an  important  influence  on  energy  system 
transformations and the potential to rapidly reduce energy CO</span>

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1515"> emissions. Energy system mitigation is 
as much about the challenges of societal change as it is about the challenges of changes in physical 
infrastructure,  technologies,  and  operations.  While  this  chapter  does  not  attempt  to  draw  a  specific 
boundary around all the different systems that interact with the energy system, it frequently explores 
these broader system interactions when assessing different mitigation options and strategies.

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1522">There is no single spatial scale at which energy systems might be defined and assessed. They can be 
assessed at the scales of homes, cities, states or provinces, countries, regions, or the entire world. These 
different scales are frequently both distinct with their own internal dynamics yet also connected to one 
another. This chapter most frequently assesses energy systems from the country and global perspective.

  <div style="" id="id1527">
    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1528">Because the energy system is so complex, it can be hard to define particular parts of it precisely, and

    <span style="font-family: TimesNewRomanPSMT; font-size: 11px;" id="id1530">there may be competing definitions in the literature. For the purposes of this chapter, &#8220;energy supply&#8221; 
encompasses all primary energy, conversion, and transmission processes with the exception of those 
that use final energy to provide energy services in the end-use sectors (transport, buildings, industry 
and  agriculture).  The  &#8220;energy  system&#8221;  includes  energy  end  uses  sectors  along  with  energy  supply.
